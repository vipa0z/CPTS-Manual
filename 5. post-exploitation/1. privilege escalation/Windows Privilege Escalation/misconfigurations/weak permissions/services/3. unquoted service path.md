When a service is installed, the registry configuration specifies a path to the binary that should be executed on service start. If this binary is not encapsulated within quotes, Windows will attempt to locate the binary in different folders. Take the example binary path below.
## how to identify
- run command to get all unquouted paths
1. is the machine misconfigured to allow standard users to place binaries in:  
- `C:\Program`
- `C:\Program Files`
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\System`
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\System Explorer\service\SystemExplorerService64` 
2.  are you able to restart the service? 
- IF You can, and able to restart the service, then go for it.
## steps:
`querying start name`
```cmd-session
C:\htb> sc qc SystemExplorerHelpService

        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem
```

#### Searching for Unquoted Service Paths
```cmd-session
wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode |findstr /i "auto" | findstr /i /v "c:\windows\\" | findstr /i /v """
```

3. replace an  msfvenom binary in any of the paths above.
