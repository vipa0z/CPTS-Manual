## Passive Traffic Capture

If `tcpdump` is installed, unprivileged users may be able to capture network traffic, including, in some cases, credentials passed in cleartext. Several tools exist, such as [net-creds](https://github.com/DanMcInerney/net-creds) and [PCredz](https://github.com/lgandx/PCredz) that can be used to examine data being passed on the wire.
# weak NFS permissions
When an NFS volume is created, various options can be set:

| Option           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `root_squash`    | If the root user is used to access NFS shares, it will be changed to the `nfsnobody` user, which is an unprivileged account. Any files created and uploaded by the root user will be owned by the `nfsnobody` user, which prevents an attacker from uploading binaries with the SUID bit set. |
| `no_root_squash` | Remote users connecting to the share as the local root user will be able to create files on the NFS server as the root user. This would allow for the creation of malicious scripts/programs with the SUID bit set.                                                                           |
