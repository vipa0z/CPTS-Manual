the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/) requires that personal data be encrypted both in transit and at rest. Nevertheless, it remains standard practice to discuss `confidential` topics or transmit `sensitive` data via email, which may be intercepted by attackers positioned to exploit these communication channels.


As more companies enhance their IT security infrastructure through training programs and security awareness seminars, it is becoming increasingly common for employees to encrypt sensitive files. Nevertheless, encrypted files can still be cracked and accessed with the right combination of wordlists and tools. In many cases, `symmetric encryption` algorithms such as `AES-256` are used to securely store individual files or folders
# this topic
we will shift our focus to techniques related to attacking password-protected files and archives.
Many different extensions correspond to encrypted files—a useful reference list can be found on [FileInfo](https://fileinfo.com/filetypes/encoded)

## Hunting for Encrypted Files
. As an example, consider this command we might use to locate commonly encrypted files on a Linux system:
```bash
for ext in $(echo ".xls .xls* .xltx .od* .doc .doc* .pdf .pot .pot* .pd* .pp*"); do
  echo -e "\nFile extension: " $ext
  find / -name *$ext 2>/dev/null | grep -v "lib\|fonts\|share\|core"
done


File extension:  .od*
/home/cry0l1t3/Docs/document-temp.odt
/home/cry0l1t3/Docs/product-improvements.odp
/home/cry0l1t3/Docs/mgmt-spreadsheet.ods
```




## Hunting for SSH keys

SSH keys usually don’t rely heavily on file extensions (the format is determined by the content), but in practice you’ll often see these:

```shell-session
$ grep -rnE '^-{5}BEGIN [A-Z0-9]+ PRIVATE KEY-{5}$' /* 2>/dev/null

/home/jsmith/.ssh/id_ed25519:1:-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
/home/jsmith/.ssh/SSH.private:1:-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
/home/jsmith/Documents/id_rsa:1:-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
<SNIP>
```

```
for ext in $(echo ".pim .pem .private"); do
  echo -e "\nFile extension: " $ext
  find / -name *$ext 2>/dev/null | grep -v "lib\|fonts\|share\|core"
done
```

Certain files, such as SSH keys, do not have standard file extension. In cases like these, it may be possible to identify files by standard content such as header and footer values. For example, SSH private keys always begin with `-----BEGIN [...SNIP...] PRIVATE KEY-----`. We can use tools like `grep` to recursively search the file system for them during post-exploitation.

Some SSH keys are encrypted with a passphrase. With older PEM formats, it was possible to tell if an SSH key is encrypted based on the header, which contains the encryption method in use. Modern SSH keys, however, appear the same whether encrypted or not.

```shell-session
$ cat /home/jsmith/.ssh/SSH.private

-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
Proc-Type: 4,ENCRYPTED
DEK-Info: AES-128-CBC,2109D25CC91F8DBFCEB0F7589066B2CC

<SNIP>
```
One way to tell whether an SSH key is encrypted or not, is to try reading the key with `ssh-keygen`.

```shell-session
$ ssh-keygen -yf ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 

ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIIpNefJd834VkD5iq+22Zh59Gzmmtzo6rAffCx2UtaS6
```

As shown below, attempting to read a password-protected SSH key will prompt the user for a passphrase:

```shell-session
ssh-keygen -yf ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Enter passphrase for "/home/jsmith/.ssh/id_rsa":
```
## Cracking encrypted SSH keys

we could use the Python script `ssh2john.py` to acquire the corresponding hash for an encrypted SSH key, and then use JtR to try and crack it.

```shell-session
ssh2john.py SSH.private > ssh.hash
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt ssh.hash
```
We can then view the resulting hash:

```shell-session
john ssh.hash --show

SSH.private:1234
```
## Cracking password-protected documents

Over the course of our careers, we are likely to encounter a wide variety of documents that are password-protected to restrict access to authorized individuals. Today, most reports, documentation, and information sheets are commonly distributed as Microsoft Office `documents` or `PDFs`. John the Ripper (JtR) includes a Python script called `office2john.py`
![](Pasted%20image%2020250621003353.png)
```shell-session
$ office2john.py Protected.docx > protected-docx.hash
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt protected-docx.hash
john protected-docx.hash --show
```
