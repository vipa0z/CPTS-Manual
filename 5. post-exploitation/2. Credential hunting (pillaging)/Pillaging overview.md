## Data Sources

Below are some of the sources from which we can obtain information from compromised systems:

- Installed applications
- Installed services
    - Websites
    - File Shares
    - Databases
    - Directory Services (such as Active Directory, Azure AD, etc.)
    - Name Servers
    - Deployment Services
    - Certificate Authority
    - Source Code Management Server
    - Virtualization
    - Messaging
    - Monitoring and Logging Systems
    - Backups
- Sensitive Data
    - Keylogging
    - Screen Capture
    - Network Traffic Capture
    - Previous Audit reports
- User Information
    - History files, interesting documents (.doc/x,.xls/x,password._/pass._, etc)
    - Roles and Privileges
    - Web Browsers
    - IM Clients


We will also find typical applications such as Office, remote management systems, IM clients, etc. We can use `dir` or `ls` to check the content of `Program Files` and `Program Files (x86)` to find which applications are installed. Although there may be other apps on the computer, this is a quick way to review them.
