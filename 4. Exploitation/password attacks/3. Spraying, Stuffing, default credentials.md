## Credential stuffing
[Credential stuffing](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Credential_stuffing) is another type of brute-force attack in which an attacker uses stolen credentials from one service to attempt
Since many users reuse their usernames and passwords across multiple platforms (such as email, social media, and enterprise systems), these attacks are sometimes successful.

if we have a list of `username:password` credentials obtained from a database leak, we can use `hydra` to perform a credential stuffing attack against an SSH service using the following syntax:



```shell-session
hydra -C user_pass.list ssh://10.100.38.23
```
## Default credentials

Many systems—such as routers, firewalls, and databases—come with `default credentials`
While several lists of known default credentials are available online, there are also dedicated tools that automate the process. One widely used example is the [Default Credentials Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/ihebski/DefaultCreds-cheat-sheet), which we can install with `pip3`.

```shell-session
pip3 install defaultcreds-cheat-sheet
```
Once installed, we can use the `creds` command to search for known default credentials associated with a specific product or vendor.
```shell-session
creds search linksys

+---------------+---------------+------------+
| Product       |    username   |  password  |
+---------------+---------------+------------+
| linksys       |    <blank>    |  <blank>   |
| linksys       |    <blank>    |   admin    |
| linksys       |    <blank>    | epicrouter |
| linksys       | Administrator |   admin    |
| linksys       |     admin     |  <blank>   |
| linksys       |     admin     |   admin    |
| linksys       |    comcast    |    1234    |
| linksys       |      root     |  orion99   |
| linksys       |      user     |  tivonpw   |
| linksys (ssh) |     admin     |   admin    |
| linksys (ssh) |     admin     |  password  |
| linksys (ssh) |    linksys    |  <blank>   |
| linksys (ssh) |      root     |   admin    |
+---------------+---------------+------------+
```
In addition to publicly available lists and tools, default credentials can often be found in product documentation, which typically
While some devices and applications prompt the user to set a password during installation, others use a default—often weak—password.

# Routers
Beyond applications, default credentials are also commonly associated with routers. One such list is available [here](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/default-router-username-and-password-list/). While it is less 
likely that router credentials remain unchanged (since these devices are critical to network security), oversights do occur. Routers used in internal testing environments, for example, may be left with default settings and can be exploited to gain further access.

# Credential stuffing
Credential stuffing attacks exploit the unfortunate reality that many users reuse passwords across multiple online accounts.

It's a multi-stage process that begins with attackers acquiring lists of compromised usernames and passwords. These lists can stem from large-scale data breaches or be compiled through phishing scams and malware. Notably, publicly available wordlists like `rockyou` or those found in `seclists` can also serve as a starting point, offering attackers a trove of commonly used passwords.
