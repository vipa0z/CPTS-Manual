## Wireshark

|Wireshark filter|Description|
|---|---|
|`ip.addr == 56.48.210.13`|Filters packets with a specific IP address|
|`tcp.port == 80`|Filters packets by port (HTTP in this case).|
|`http`|Filters for HTTP traffic.|
|`dns`|Filters DNS traffic, which is useful to monitor domain name resolution.|
|`tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0`|Filters SYN packets (used in TCP handshakes), useful for detecting scanning or connection attempts.|
|`icmp`|Filters ICMP packets (used for Ping), which can be useful for reconnaissance or network issues.|
|`http.request.method == "POST"`|Filters for HTTP POST requests. In the case that POST requests are sent over unencrypted HTTP, it may be the case that passwords or other sensitive information is contained within.|
|`tcp.stream eq 53`|Filters for a specific TCP stream. Helps track a conversation between two hosts.|
|`eth.addr == 00:11:22:33:44:55`|Filters packets from/to a specific MAC address.|
|`ip.src == 192.168.24.3 && ip.dst == 56.48.210.3`|Filters traffic between two specific IP addresses. Helps track communication between specific hosts.|
it's possible to locate packets that contain specific bytes or strings. One way to do this is by using a display filter such as `http contains "passw"`. Alternatively, you can navigate to `Edit > Find Packet` and enter the desired search query manually. For example, you might search for packets containing the string `"passw"`:

![Network packet capture showing HTTP requests with details. Highlighted POST request includes HTML form data with username and password fields.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/308/img/Net_3.png)

It's worth familiarizing yourself with the syntax of Wireshark's filtering engine, especially if you ever need to perform network traffic analysis.
## Pcredz

[Pcredz](https://github.com/lgandx/PCredz) is a tool that can be used to extract credentials from live traffic or network packet captures. Specifically, it supports extracting the following information:

- Credit card numbers
- POP credentials
- SMTP credentials
- IMAP credentials
- SNMP community strings
- FTP credentials
- Credentials from HTTP NTLM/Basic headers, as well as HTTP Forms
- NTLMv1/v2 hashes from various traffic including DCE-RPC, SMBv1/2, LDAP, MSSQL, and HTTP
- Kerberos (AS-REQ Pre-Auth etype 23) hashes
