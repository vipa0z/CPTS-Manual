## Identifying Hosts

First, let's take some time to listen to the network and see what's going on. e can use `Wireshark` and `TCPDump` to "put our ear to the wire"

```shell-session
 $ sudo -E wireshark
```
notice some [ARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) requests and replies, [MDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS), and other basic [layer two](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/multicast-l2/topics/topic-map/layer-2-understanding.html) packets in the broadcast domain
- ARP packets make us aware of the hosts: xxxx, xxxxx, x.x.x.x
- MDNS makes us aware of the Server hosts. like: WEB0.ACAD
## tcpdump
We can also use tcpdump to save a capture to a .pcap file, transfer it to another host, and open it in Wireshark.
```shell-session
sudo tcpdump -i ens224 
```
## Responder in view mode

```bash
sudo responder -I ens224 -A 
```

## Password sniffing
- [ ] [net-creds](https://github.com/DanMcInerney/net-creds), and [NetMiner](https://www.netminer.com/en/product/netminer.php),

## Honeypot detection

- [ ] look for weird hostnames, non standard  `host` multicast IP, and untypical usage of LLMNR and NB-NS ( they're typically used at the same time for legit requests) 
- [ ] read more about it later.
