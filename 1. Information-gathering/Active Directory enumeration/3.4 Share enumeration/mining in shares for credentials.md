## Snaffler

[Snaffler](https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler) is a tool that can help us acquire credentials or other sensitive data in an Active Directory environment. Snaffler works by obtaining a list of hosts within the domain and then enumerating those hosts for shares and readable directories. Once that is done, it iterates through any directories readable by our user and hunts for files that could serve to better our position within the assessment. Snaffler requires that it be run from a domain-joined host or in a domain-user context.

```bash
Snaffler.exe -s -d inlanefreight.local -o snaffler.log -v data
