### Password in Description Field
Sensitive information such as account passwords are sometimes found in the user account `Description` or `Notes` fields and can be quickly enumerated using PowerView. For large domains, it is helpful to export this data to a CSV file to review offline.
#### using Get-Domain User
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser * | Select-Object samaccountname,description |Where-Object {$_.Description -ne $null}

samaccountname description
-------------- -----------
administrator  Built-in account for administering the computer/domain
guest          Built-in account for guest access to the computer/domain
krbtgt         Key Distribution Center Service Account
ldap.agent     *** DO NOT CHANGE ***  3/12/2012: Sunsh1ne4All!
```

## PASSWD_NOTREQD Field

It is possible to come across domain accounts with the [passwd_notreqd](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=PASSWD_NOTREQD) field set in the userAccountControl attribute. If this is set, the user is not subject to the current password policy length, meaning they could have a shorter password or no password at all (if empty passwords are allowed in the domain).
assessments). Also, include it in the client report if the goal of the assessment is to be as comprehensive as possible.
#### Enumerate for accounts with no password required

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -UACFilter PASSWD_NOTREQD | Select-Object samaccountname,useraccountcontrol
```

## Credentials in SMB Shares and SYSVOL Scripts
be a treasure trove of data, especially in large organizations. We may find many different batch, VBScript, and PowerShell scripts within the scripts directory, which is readable by all authenticated users in the domain. It is worth digging around this directory to hunt for passwords stored in scripts. Sometimes we will find very old scripts containing since disabled accounts or old passwords, but from time to time, we will strike gold, so we should always dig through this directory. Here, we can see an interesting script named `reset_local_admin_pass.vbs`.

## Group Policy Preferences (GPP) Passwords

When a new GPP is created, an .xml file is created in the SYSVOL share, which is also cached locally on endpoints that the Group Policy applies to. These files can include those used to:

- Map drives (drives.xml)
- Create local users
- Create printer config files (printers.xml)
- Creating and updating services (services.xml)
- Creating scheduled tasks (scheduledtasks.xml)
- Changing local admin passwords.

These files can contain an array of configuration data and defined passwords. The `cpassword` attribute value is AES-256 bit encrypted, but Microsoft [published the AES private key on MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-gppref/2c15cbf0-f086-4c74-8b70-1f2fa45dd4be?redirectedfrom=MSDN), which can be used to decrypt the password. Any domain user can read these files as they are stored on the SYSVOL share, and all authenticated users in a domain, by default, have read access to this domain controller share.

This was patched in 2014 [MS14-025 Vulnerability in GPP could allow elevation of privilege](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/ms14-025-vulnerability-in-group-policy-preferences-could-allow-elevation-of-privilege-may-13-2014-60734e15-af79-26ca-ea53-8cd617073c30), to prevent administrators from setting passwords using GPP. The patch does not remove existing Groups.xml files with passwords from SYSVOL. If you delete the GPP policy instead of unlinking it from the OU, the cached copy on the local computer remains.

The XML looks like the following:

If you retrieve the cpassword value more manually, the `gpp-decrypt` utility can be used to decrypt the password as follows:

### Users with do not require kerberos Pre Authentication
It's possible to obtain the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for any account that has the [Do not require Kerberos pre-authentication](https://www.tenable.com/blog/how-to-stop-the-kerberos-pre-authentication-attack-in-active-directory) setting enabled. Many vendor installation guides specify that their service account be configured in this way. The authentication service reply (AS_REP) is encrypted with the accountâ€™s password, and any domain user can request it.
![](Active%20Directory/Windows/Active%20Directory/modules/OSINT/Screenshotsin/Pasted%20image%2020241224175018.png)
With pre-authentication, a user enters their password, which encrypts a time stamp. The Domain Controller will decrypt this to validate that the correct password was used. If successful, a TGT will be issued to the user for further authentication requests in the domain. If an account has pre-authentication disabled, an attacker can request authentication data for the affected account and retrieve an encrypted TGT from the Domain Controller. This can be subjected to an offline password attack using a tool such as Hashcat or John the Ripper.
Even if we are unable to crack the AS-REP using Hashcat it is still good to report this as a finding to clients (just lower risk if we cannot crack the password) so they can assess whether or not the account requires this setting.

## Group Policy Object (GPO) Abuse via ACL abuse
GPO misconfigurations can be abused to perform the following attacks:

- Adding additional rights to a user (such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, or SeImpersonatePrivilege)
- Adding a local admin user to one or more hosts
- Creating an immediate scheduled task to perform any number of actions
- use [group3r](https://github.com/Group3r/Group3r), [ADRecon](https://github.com/sense-of-security/ADRecon), [PingCastle](https://www.pingcastle.com/), among others, to audit the security of GPOs in a domain.
- This can be helpful for us to begin to see what types of security measures are in place (such as denying cmd.exe access and a separate password policy for service accounts). We can see that autologon is in use which may mean there is a readable password in a GPO, and see that Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is present in the domain. If Group Policy Management Tools are installed on the host we are working from, we can use various built-in [GroupPolicy cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/grouppolicy/?view=windowsserver2022-ps) such as `Get-GPO` to perform the same enumeration.
```powershell-session
#LAYOFLAND:
$ Get-GPO -All | Select DisplayName

#PV:
$ Get-DomainGPO |select displayname
displayname
-----------
Default Domain Policy
Default Domain Controllers Policy
Deny Control Panel Access
Disallow LM Hash

```
check if a user we can control has any rights over a GPO. Specific users or groups may be granted rights to administer one or more GPOs. A good first check is to see if the entire Domain Users group has any rights over one or more GPOs.
```powershell-session
sid=Convert-NameToSid "Domain Users"
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainGPO | Get-ObjectAcl | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid}
```
Here we can see that the Domain Users group has various permissions over a GPO, such as `WriteProperty` and `WriteDacl`, which we could leverage to give ourselves full control over the GPO and pull off any number of attacks that would be pushed down to any users and computers in OUs that the GPO is applied to. We can use the GPO GUID combined with `Get-GPO` to see the display name of the GPO.
#### Converting GPO GUID to Name

Miscellaneous Misconfigurations

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb Get-GPO -Guid 7CA9C789-14CE-46E3-A722-83F4097AF532
```
Checking in BloodHound, we can see that the `Domain Users` group has several rights over the `Disconnect Idle RDP` GPO, which could be leveraged for full control of the object.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/gporights.png)

If we select the GPO in BloodHound and scroll down to `Affected Objects` on the `Node Info` tab, we can see that this GPO is applied to one OU, which contains four computer objects.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/gpoaffected.png)

We could use a tool such as [SharpGPOAbuse](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/SharpGPOAbuse) to take advantage of this GPO misconfiguration by performing actions such as adding a user that we control to the local admins group on one of the affected hosts, creating an immediate scheduled task on one of the hosts to give us a reverse shell, or configure a malicious computer startup script to provide us with a reverse shell or similar. When using a tool like this, we need to be careful because commands can be run that affect every computer within the OU that the GPO is linked to. If we found an editable GPO that applies to an OU with 1,000 computers, we would not want to make the mistake of adding ourselves as a local admin to that many hosts. Some of the attack options available with this tool allow us to specify a target user or host. The hosts shown in the above image are not exploitable, and GPO attacks will be covered in-depth in a later module.
