## [AppLocker](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/applocker/what-is-applocker) 
is Microsoft's application whitelisting solution and gives system administrators control over which applications and files users can run

It provides granular control over executables, scripts, Windows installer files, DLLs, packaged apps, and packed app installers. It is common for organizations to block cmd.exe and PowerShell.exe and write access to certain directories, but this can all be bypassed. Organizations also often focus on 
# pwshell
blocking the `PowerShell.exe` executable, but forget about the other [PowerShell executable locations](https://www.powershelladmin.com/wiki/PowerShell_Executables_File_System_Locations) such as `%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` or `PowerShell_ISE.exe`. We can see that this is the case in the `AppLocker` rules shown below. All Domain Users are disallowed from running the 64-bit PowerShell executable located at:

`%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`

So, we can merely call it from other locations. Sometimes, we run into more stringent `AppLocker` policies that require more creativity to bypass. These ways will be covered in other modules.

## PowerShell Constrained Language Mode

PowerShell [Constrained Language Mode](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-constrained-language-mode/) locks down many of the features needed to use PowerShell effectively, such as blocking COM objects, only allowing approved .NET types, XAML-based workflows, PowerShell classes, and more. We can quickly enumerate whether we are in Full Language Mode or Constrained Language Mode.

## LAPS

The Microsoft [Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899) is used to randomize and rotate local administrator passwords on Windows hosts and prevent lateral movement. We can enumerate what domain users can read the LAPS password set for machines with LAPS installed and what machines do not have LAPS installed. The [LAPSToolkit](https://github.com/leoloobeek/LAPSToolkit) greatly facilitates this with several functions. One is parsing `ExtendedRights` for all computers with LAPS enabled. This will show groups specifically delegated to read LAPS passwords, which are often users in protected groups. An account that has joined a computer to a domain receives `All Extended Rights` over that host, and this right gives the account the ability to read passwords. Enumeration may show a user account that can read the LAPS password on a host. This can help us target specific AD users who can read LAPS passwords.

#### Using Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups

OrgUnit                                             Delegated Groups
-------                                             ----------------
OU=Servers,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL                INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins
OU=Servers,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL                INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins
OU=Workstations,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL           INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins
OU=Workstations,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL           INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins
OU=Web Servers,OU=Servers,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins
```

The `Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights` checks the rights on each computer with LAPS enabled for any groups with read access and users with "All Extended Rights." Users with "All Extended Rights" can read LAPS passwords and may be less protected than users in delegated groups, so this is worth checking for.

Enumerating Security Controls

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights

ComputerName                Identity                    Reason
------------                --------                    ------
EXCHG01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins Delegated
EXCHG01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins   Delegated
```

We can use the `Get-LAPSComputers` function to search for computers that have LAPS enabled when passwords expire, and even the randomized passwords in cleartext if our user has access.

#### Using Get-LAPSComputers
