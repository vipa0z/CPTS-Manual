### LAPS

The Microsoft [Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899) is used to randomize and rotate local administrator passwords on Windows hosts and prevent lateral movement.

We can enumerate what domain users can read the LAPS password set for machines with LAPS installed and what machines do not have LAPS installed. The [LAPSToolkit](https://github.com/leoloobeek/LAPSToolkit) greatly facilitates this with several functions. One is parsing `ExtendedRights` for all computers with LAPS enabled. This will show groups specifically delegated to read LAPS passwords, which are often users in protected groups. 

An account that has joined a computer to a domain receives `All Extended Rights` over that host, and this right gives the account the ability to read passwords.

Enumeration may show a user account that can read the LAPS password on a host. This can help us target specific AD users who can read LAPS passwords.
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups

OU=Staff Workstations,OU=Workstations,DC=INLANEF... INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins
OU=Executive Workstations,OU=Workstations,DC=INL... INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins
OU=Executive Workstations,OU=Workstations,DC=INL... INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins
OU=Mail Servers,OU=Servers,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=L... INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins
OU=Mail Servers,OU=Servers,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=L... INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins
```

The `Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights` checks the rights on each computer with LAPS enabled for any groups with read access and users with "All Extended Rights." Users with "All Extended Rights" can read LAPS passwords and may be less protected than users in delegated groups
```powershell-session
Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights

ComputerName                Identity                    Reason
------------                --------                    ------
EXCHG01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins Delegated
```

We can use the `Get-LAPSComputers` function to search for computers that have LAPS enabled when passwords expire, and even the randomized passwords in cleartext if our user has access.
```powershell-session
Get-LAPSComputers
```
