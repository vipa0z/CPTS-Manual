## LDAP ANONYMOUS BIND
With an LDAP anonymous bind, we can use LDAP-specific enumeration tools
`windapsearch.py`, `ldapsearch`, `ad-ldapdomaindump.py`

ldapsearch is a bit manual and requires knowing the right syntax. here's an example:
```shell-session
$ ldapsearch <-h or -H> 172.16.5.5 -x -b "DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL" -s sub "*" | grep -m 1 -B 10 pwdHistoryLength
```

ldap authenticated:
```shell
ldapsearch -h 172.16.5.5 -x -D "CN=svc_ldap,OU=Service Accounts,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL" -w 'P@ssw0rd!' -b "DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL" -s sub "(objectClass=*)" sAMAccountName

sAMAccountName: jsmith
dn: CN=Jane Doe,OU=Admins,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
sAMAccountName: jdoe
```

with powerview
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> import-module .\PowerView.ps1
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainPolicy
```
powerview revealed that password complexity is enabled (`PasswordComplexity=1`).

### Complexity
Password complexity is enabled, meaning that a user must choose a password with 3/4 of the following: an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, special character (`Password1` or `Welcome1` would satisfy the "complexity" requirement here, but are still clearly weak passwords).

The default password policy when a new domain is created is as follows, and there have been plenty of organizations that never changed this policy:

| Policy                                      | Default Value |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Enforce password history                    | 24 days       |
| Maximum password age                        | 42 days       |
| Minimum password age                        | 1 day         |
| Minimum password length                     | 7             |
| Password must meet complexity requirements  | Enabled       |
| Store passwords using reversible encryption | Disabled      |
| Account lockout duration                    | Not set       |
| Account lockout threshold                   | 0             |
| Reset account lockout counter after         | Not set       |
