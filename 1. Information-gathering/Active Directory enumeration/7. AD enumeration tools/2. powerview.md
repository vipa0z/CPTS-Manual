## PowerView (read domain enumeration guide)

 Much like BloodHound, it provides a way to identify where users are logged in on a network, enumerate domain information such as users, computers, groups, ACLS, trusts, hunt for file shares and passwords, perform Kerberoasting, and more. It is a highly versatile tool that can provide us with great insight into the security posture of our client's domain. 
 
 It requires more manual work to determine misconfigurations and relationships within the domain than BloodHound but, when used right, can help us to identify subtle misconfigurations.

## Access Control enumeration
Powerview can list ACEs for Secured Objects, in this example we're:
listing every ACE in the domain where the  Security identifier of the owner matches `attackersid`

  lets test  get-domainobjectACL
```powershell-session
Get-DomainObjectACL -Identity * | ? {$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid}
```


  
OR:   
  ```
  find-interestingdomainAcl | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -match $attackerSid}
```

. what all this means is that we are finding all access rights on every object that the user `wley` has.

![[Pasted image 20250726155055.png]]
in this example ACE our compomised user wley has `ObjectAceType/GuidRight` of `00299570-246d-11d0-a768-00aa006e0529`   which is translated to: `Reset Password` over  `dana amundsun` 

Note: this method takes TIME (as it performs enumeration on every ACE) which is not efficient.

## Groups

We can use the [Get-DomainGroupMember](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-DomainGroupMember/) function to retrieve group-specific information. Adding the `-Recurse` switch tells PowerView that if it finds any groups that are part of the target group (nested group membership)


`Secadmins` group is part of the `Domain Admins` group through nested group membership.
we will be able to view all of the members of that group who inherit Domain Admin rights via their group membership.
```powershell
 Get-DomainGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Recurse
```
