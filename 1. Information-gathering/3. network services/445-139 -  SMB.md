Using `smbmap` with the `-r` or `-R` (recursive) option, one can browse the directories:

```shell-session
smbmap -H 10.129.14.128 -r notes

       dr--r--r               0 Mon Nov  2 00:57:44 2020    ..
        dr--r--r               0 Mon Nov  2 00:57:44 2020    LDOUJZWBSG
        fw--w--w             116 Tue Apr 16 07:43:19 2019    note.txt
```
download files
```shell-session
$ smbmap -H 10.129.14.128 --download "notes\note.txt"
```

# from Windows
There are different ways we can interact with a shared folder using Windows, and we will explore a couple of them. On Windows GUI, we can press `[WINKEY] + [R]` to open the Run dialog box and type the file share location, e.g.: `\\192.168.220.129\Finance\`

![Windows Server 2012 R2 desktop with Run dialog open, showing network path entry.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/116/windows_run_sharefolder2.jpg)

Suppose the shared folder allows anonymous authentication, or we are authenticated with a user who has privilege over that shared folder. In that case, we will not receive any form of authentication request, and it will display the content of the shared folder.

![File explorer open to network path \192.168.220.133\Finance showing Contracts folder.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/116/finance_share_folder2.jpg)

If we do not have access, we will receive an authentication request.
with `dir` 
```
dir \\IP\SHARE
```
## Mounting shares
with `net` mount share to  drive `n`
```
net use n: \\192.168.220.129\Finance
```
with authentication
```
net use n: \\192.168.220.129\Finance /user:plaintext Password123
```

another way of mounting
```powershell-session
New-PSDrive -Name "N" -Root "\\192.168.220.129\Finance" -PSProvider "FileSystem"
```
with creds
```powershell-session
 $username = 'plaintext'
PS C:\htb> $password = 'Password123'
PS C:\htb> $secpassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force
PS C:\htb> $cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $secpassword
PS C:\htb> New-PSDrive -Name "N" -Root "\\192.168.220.129\Finance" -PSProvider "FileSystem" -Credential $cred
```
## Mounting shares on linux
```shell-session
$ sudo mkdir /mnt/Finance
$ sudo mount -t cifs -o username=plaintext,password=Password123,domain=. //192.168.220.129/Finance /mnt/Finance
```
As an alternative, we can use a credential file.

```shell-session
mount -t cifs //192.168.220.129/Finance /mnt/Finance -o credentials=/path/credentialfile
```

The file `credentialfile` has to be structured like this:

```txt
username=plaintext
password=Password123
domain=.
```
We need to install `cifs-utils` to connect to an SMB share folder. To install it we can execute from the command line `sudo apt install cifs-utils`.
once mounted we can start search

hunt for a filename that contains the string `cred`:
```shell-session
$ find /mnt/Finance/ -name *cred*
```
Next, let's find files that contain the string `cred`:
```shell-session
grep -rn /mnt/Finance/ -ie cred

	/mnt/Finance/Contracts/private/credentials.txt:1:admin:SecureCredentials!
```
---------------
## listing shares content
list number of files
```powershell-session
 N:
PS N:\> (Get-ChildItem -File -Recurse | Measure-Object).Count
```

```powershell-session
Get-ChildItem \\192.168.220.129\Finance\
```
-------- 
## hunting for passwords
```
findstr /s /i /n /c:"pass" /c:"password" /c:"secret" N:\* > results.out
```

hunting for tokens
```
findstr /s /i /n /c:"token" /c:"admin"
```

multi search terms
```
findstr /s /i /n /g:stringlist.txt N:\* > results.out
```

with get-childitem
```powershell-session
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path N:\ -Include *cred* -File
```

with select-string
```powershell-session
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path N:\ | Select-String "cred" -List
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path N:\ | Select-String "pass" -List
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Path N:\ | Select-String "secret" -List

N:\Contracts\private\secret.txt:1:file with all credentials
N:\Contracts\private\credentials.txt:1:admin:SecureCredentials!
```
