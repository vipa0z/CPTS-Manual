## Overview



This repository contains my structured notes and walkthroughs designed to support preparation for the **CPTS exam**, as well as Pentests and CTF challenges. It documents attack chains from external reconnaissance to internal network/domain exploration and post-exploitation.  

> ⚠️ **Note:** This guide is **not definitive**. You should always build your **own methodology and notes**, tailored to your learning style and lab environments. Use this repository only as a **reference** or starting point.

The content is intended as a **study and reference manual**.
