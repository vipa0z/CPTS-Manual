```shell-session
$ mysql -u root -h docker.hackthebox.eu -P 3306 -p 

Enter password: 
...SNIP...

mysql> 
```

select DB
```
USE DBNAME;
```

show tables
```
show tables;
```

get table columns
```

Note: The default MySQL/MariaDB port is (3306), but it can be configured to another port. It is specified using an uppercase `P`, unlike the lowercase `p` used for passwords.

## Creating a database

Once we log in to the database using the `mysql` utility, we can start using SQL queries to interact with the DBMS. For example, a new database can be created within the MySQL DBMS using the [CREATE DATABASE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-database.html) statement.

Intro to MySQL

```shell-session
mysql> CREATE DATABASE users;

Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)
```

MySQL expects command-line queries to be terminated with a semi-colon. The example above created a new database named `users`. We can view the list of databases with [SHOW DATABASES](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/show-databases.html), and we can switch to the `users` database with the `USE` statement:

Intro to MySQL

```shell-session
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;

+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| mysql              |
| performance_schema |
| sys                |
| users              |
+--------------------+

mysql> USE users;

Database changed
```

SQL statements aren't case sensitive, which means 'USE users;' and 'use users;' refer to the same command. However, the database name is case sensitive, so we cannot do 'USE USERS;' instead of 'USE users;'. So, it is a good practice to specify statements in uppercase to avoid confusion.

---

## Tables

DBMS stores data in the form of tables. A table is made up of horizontal rows and vertical columns. The intersection of a row and a column is called a cell. Every table is created with a fixed set of columns, where each column is of a particular data type.

A data type defines what kind of value is to be held by a column. Common examples are `numbers`, `strings`, `date`, `time`, and `binary data`. There could be data types specific to DBMS as well. A complete list of data types in MySQL can be found [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/data-types.html). For example, let us create a table named `logins` to store user data, using the [CREATE TABLE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/creating-tables.html) SQL query:

Code: sql

```sql
CREATE TABLE logins (
    id INT,
    username VARCHAR(100),
    password VARCHAR(100),
    date_of_joining DATETIME
    );
```

As we can see, the `CREATE TABLE` query first specifies the table name, and then (within parentheses) we specify each column by its name and its data type, all being comma separated. After the name and type, we can specify specific properties, as will be discussed later.

```shell-session
mysql> CREATE TABLE logins (
    ->     id INT,
    ->     username VARCHAR(100),
    ->     password VARCHAR(100),
    ->     date_of_joining DATETIME
    ->     );
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)
```

characters each. Any input longer than this will result in an error. The `date_of_joining` column of type `DATETIME` stores the date when an entry was added.
A list of tables in the current database can be obtained using the `SHOW TABLES` statement. In addition, the [DESCRIBE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/describe.html) keyword is used to list the table structure with its fields and data types.

Intro to MySQL

```shell-session
mysql> DESCRIBE logins;
```

```shell-session
mysql> SHOW TABLES;

+-----------------+
| Tables_in_users |
+-----------------+
| logins          |
+-----------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

A list of tables in the current database can be obtained using the `SHOW TABLES` statement. In addition, the [DESCRIBE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/describe.html) keyword is used to list the table structure with its fields and data types.
altering table columns
# alter statements
modify table column's type
```shell-session
mysql> ALTER TABLE logins MODIFY timet0day  DATE;
```

Rename colunm
```shell-session
 ALTER TABLE logins RENAME COLUMN newColumn TO newerColumn;
```

add new column
```
mysql> ALTER TABLE logins add newerColumn DATE;
```

drop a column 
```shell-session
mysql> ALTER TABLE logins DROP newerColumn;
```

# Update statements

he [UPDATE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/update.html) statement can be used to update specific records within a table, based on certain conditions. Its general syntax is:
```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1=newvalue1, column2=newvalue2, ... WHERE <condition>;
```

```shell-session
UPDATE logins SET password = 'change_password' WHERE id > 1;
```
# ORDER BY
columns
```shell-session
> SELECT * FROM logins ORDER BY password
```
ascending
descending
```shell-session
> SELECT * FROM logins ORDER BY password DESC;/ASC
```

It is also possible to sort by multiple columns, to have a secondary sort for duplicate values in one column:

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins ORDER BY password DESC, id ASC;

+----+---------------+-----------------+---------------------+
| id | username      | password        | date_of_joining     |
+----+---------------+-----------------+---------------------+
|  1 | admin         | p@ssw0rd        | 2020-07-02 00:00:00 |
|  2 | administrator | change_password | 2020-07-02 11:30:50 |
|  3 | john          | change_password | 2020-07-02 11:47:16 |
|  4 | tom           | change_password | 2020-07-02 11:50:20 |
+----+---------------+-----------------+---------------------+
```

# LIMIT RESULTS
```shell-session
LIMIT 2;
```

## LIKE Clause

Another useful SQL clause is [LIKE](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/pattern-matching.html), enabling selecting records by matching a certain pattern. The query below retrieves all records with usernames starting with `admin`:


```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username LIKE 'admin%';

+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
| id | username      | password   | date_of_joining     |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
|  1 | admin         | p@ssw0rd   | 2020-07-02 00:00:00 |
|  4 | administrator | adm1n_p@ss | 2020-07-02 15:19:02 |
+----+---------------+------------+---------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

The `%` symbol acts as a wildcard and matches all characters after `admin`. It is used to match zero or more characters. Similarly,



the `_` symbol is used to match exactly one character. The below query matches all usernames with exactly three characters in them, which in this case was `tom`:

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT * FROM logins WHERE username like '___';

+----+----------+----------+---------------------+
| id | username | password | date_of_joining     |
+----+----------+----------+---------------------+
|  3 | tom      | tom123!  | 2020-07-02 15:18:56 |
+----+----------+----------+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
```

# OPERATORS

### AND
The result of the `AND` operation is `true` if and only if both `condition1` and `condition2` evaluate to `true`:

```shell-session
mysql> SELECT 1 = 1 AND 'test' = 'test';

+---------------------------+
| 1 = 1 AND 'test' = 'test' |
+---------------------------+
|                         1 |
+---------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT 1 = 1 AND 'test' = 'abc';

+--------------------------+
| 1 = 1 AND 'test' = 'abc' |
+--------------------------+
|                        0 |
+--------------------------+
```

1 =1 IS TRUE AND TEST=TEST IS TRUE SO IT WILL EVALUATE TO TRUE

Here is a list of common operations and their precedence, as seen in the [MariaDB Documentation](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/operator-precedence/):

- Division (`/`), Multiplication (`*`), and Modulus (`%`)
- Addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`)
- Comparison (`=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=`, `LIKE`)
- NOT (`!`)
- AND (`&&`)
- OR (`||`)
