### 1. Insecure web server configurations 

```
curl -i -X OPTIONS http://SERVER_IP:PORT/
```

causes the first type of HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerabilities. A web server's authentication configuration may be limited to specific HTTP methods, which would leave some HTTP methods accessible without authentication.
```xml
<Limit GET POST>
    Require valid-user
</Limit>
```
even though the configuration specifies both `GET` and `POST` requests for the authentication method, an attacker may still use a different HTTP method (like `HEAD`) to bypass this authentication mechanism altogether,

### 2.  HTTP Tampering vulnerabilities caused by insecure coding. 
```php
$pattern = "/^[A-Za-z\s]+$/";

if(preg_match($pattern, $_GET["code"])) {
    $query = "Select * from ports where port_code like '%" . $_REQUEST["code"] . "%'";
    ...SNIP...
}
```
