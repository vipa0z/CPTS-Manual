sometimes the responses like "only images are allowed" may indicate (not consisely) that your request is not properly structured, throught the file uploads lab i found out that adding these headers/tricks, could prove useful:
# missing headers
##  set boundary
```

Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------6129640274014026624233989589

```

EXAMPLE
![](Pasted%20image%2020250520215002.png)

# 2 Set Content-disposition header + type header
```
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="uploadFile"; filename="SVG-XXE-Injection.svg"
Content-Type: image/svg+xml
```
