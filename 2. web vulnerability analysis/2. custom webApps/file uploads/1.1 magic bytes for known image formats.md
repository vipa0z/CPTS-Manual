so you can trick file upload filters.


# GIF
Many other image types have non-printable bytes for their file signatures, while a `GIF` image starts with ASCII printable bytes (as shown above), so it is the easiest to imitate. Furthermore, as the string `GIF8` is common between both GIF signatures, it is usually enough to imitate a GIF image.
```BASH
echo "GIF8" > text.jpg 
file text.jpg
text.jpg: GIF image data
```

We can use a combination of the two methods discussed in this section, which may help us bypass some more robust content filters.

For example, we can try using an `Allowed MIME type with a disallowed Content-Type`, an `Allowed MIME/Content-Type with a disallowed extension`, or a `Disallowed MIME/Content-Type with an allowed extension`, and so on. Similarly, we can attempt other combinations and permutations to try to confuse the web server, and depending on the level of code security, we may be able to bypass various filters.
