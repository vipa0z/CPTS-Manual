# useful tricks (XSS via file upload)


## image metadata
modify with exiftool if the web app renders metadata like comment, name, artist, it can be triggered. 
```bash
exiftool -Comment=' "><img src=1 onerror=alert(window.origin)>' HTB.jpg
exiftool HTB.jpg
...SNIP...
Comment                         :  "><img src=1 onerror=alert(window.origin)>
```
### text/html content-type
if we change the image's MIME-Type to `text/html`, some web applications may show it as an HTML document instead of an image, in which case the XSS payload would be triggered even if the metadata wasn't directly displayed.

##  SVG images
XSS example
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" width="1" height="1">
    <rect x="1" y="1" width="1" height="1" fill="green" stroke="black" />
    <script type="text/javascript">alert(window.origin);</script>
</svg>
```

### XXE via SVG IMAGE example:

Similar attacks can be carried to lead to XXE exploitation. With SVG images, we can also include malicious XML data to leak the source code of the web application, and other internal documents within the server. The following example can be used for an SVG image that leaks the content of (`/etc/passwd`):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<svg>&xxe;</svg>
```

To use XXE to read source code in PHP web applications, we can use the following payload in our SVG image:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php"> ]>
<svg>&xxe;</svg>
```
Using XML data is not unique to SVG images, as it is also utilized by many types of documents, like `PDF`, `Word Documents`, `PowerPoint Documents`, among many others.

Using XML data is not unique to SVG images, as it is also utilized by many types of documents, like `PDF`, `Word Documents`, `PowerPoint Documents`, among many others. All of these documents include XML data within them to specify their format and structure. Suppose a web application used a document viewer that is vulnerable to XXE and allowed uploading any of these documents. In that case, we may also modify their XML data to

## DoS

Finally, many file upload vulnerabilities may lead to a `Denial of Service (DOS)` attack on the web server. For example, we can use the previous XXE payloads to achieve DoS attacks, as discussed in the [Web Attacks](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/134) module.

Furthermore, we can utilize a `Decompression Bomb` with file types that use data compression, like `ZIP` archives. If a web application automatically unzips a ZIP archive, it is possible to upload a malicious archive containing nested ZIP archives within it, which can eventually lead to many Petabytes of data, resulting in a crash on the back-end server.

Another possible DoS attack is a `Pixel Flood` attack with some image files that utilize image compression, like `JPG` or `PNG`. We can create any `JPG` image file with any image size (e.g. `500x500`), and then manually modify its compression data to say it has a size of (`0xffff x 0xffff`), which results in an image with a perceived size of 4 Gigapixels. When the web application attempts to display the image, it will attempt to allocate all of its memory to this image, resulting in a crash on the back-end server.
```
convert xc: +noise Random 10000x10000 <path>
```
```
exiftool -imageHeight=99999 -imageWidth=90000
```
If the upload function is vulnerable to directory traversal, we may also attempt uploading files to a different directory (e.g. `../../../etc/passwd`), which may also cause the server to crash. `Try to search for other examples of DOS attacks through a vulnerable file upload functionality`.


## Advanced File Upload Attacks

### making the web server disclose uploads directory
Another method we can use to disclose the uploads directory is through forcing error messages, as they often reveal helpful information for further exploitation. One attack we can use to cause such errors is uploading a file with a name that already exists or sending two identical requests simultaneously. This may lead the web server to show an error that it could not write the file, which may disclose the uploads directory. We may also try uploading a file with an overly long name (e.g., 5,000 characters). If the web application does not handle this correctly, it may also error out and disclose the upload directory.
## Windows-specific Attacks
we may use Windows reserved names for the uploaded file name, like (`CON`, `COM1`, `LPT1`, or `NUL`), which may also cause an error as the web application will not be allowed to write a file with this name.
Finally, we may utilize the Windows [8.3 Filename Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename) to overwrite existing files or refer to files that do not exist. Older versions of Windows were limited to a short length for file names, so they used a Tilde character (`~`) to complete the file name, which we can use to our advantage.

For example, to refer to a file called (`hackthebox.txt`) we can use (`HAC~1.TXT`) or (`HAC~2.TXT`), where the digit represents the order of the matching files that start with (`HAC`). As Windows still supports this convention, we can write a file called (e.g. `WEB~.CONF`) to overwrite the `web.conf` file. Similarly, we may write a file that replaces sensitive system files. 

This attack can lead to several outcomes, like causing information disclosure through errors, causing a DoS on the back-end server, or even accessing private files.

## Injections in File Name

A common file upload attack uses a malicious string for the uploaded file name, which may get executed or processed if the uploaded file name is displayed (i.e., reflected) on the page. We can try injecting a command in the file name, and if the web application uses the file name within an OS command, it may lead to a command injection attack.

For example, if we name a file `file$(whoami).jpg` or ``file`whoami`.jpg`` or `file.jpg||whoami`, and then the web application attempts to move the uploaded file with an OS command (e.g. `mv file /tmp`), then our file name would inject the `whoami` command, which would get executed, leading to remote code execution. You may refer to the [Command Injections](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/109) module for more information.

Similarly, we may use an XSS payload in the file name (e.g. `<script>alert(window.origin);</script>`), which would get executed on the target's machine if the file name is displayed to them. We may also inject an SQL query in the file name (e.g. `file';select+sleep(5);--.jpg`), which may lead to an SQL injection if the file name is insecurely used in an SQL query.
# 2
In addition to all of the attacks we have discussed in this module, there are more advanced attacks that can be used with file upload functionalities. Any automatic processing that occurs to an uploaded file, like encoding a video, compressing a file, or renaming a file, may be exploited if not securely coded.
Some commonly used libraries may have public exploits for such vulnerabilities, like the AVI upload vulnerability leading to XXE in `ffmpeg`. However, when dealing with custom code and custom libraries, detecting such vulnerabilities requires more advanced knowledge and techniques, which may lead to discovering an advanced file upload vulnerability in some web applications.

There are many other advanced file upload vulnerabilities that we did not discuss in this module. Try to read some bug bounty reports to explore more advanced file upload vulnerabilities.
