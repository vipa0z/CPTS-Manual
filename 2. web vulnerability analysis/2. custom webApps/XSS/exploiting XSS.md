# SESSION HIJACKING


find a script  payload that calls back home

2. host a server.php, that holds script.js file 
3. this script.js embedds a script that calls your server.php with the user's cookie

# a couple of payloads to know:
One such XSS payload is `<plaintext>`,
 which will stop rendering the HTML code that comes after it and display it as plaintext.
 
 Another easy-to-spot payload is `<script>print()</script>` that will pop up the browser print dialog, which is unlikely to be blocked by any browsers. Try using these payloads to see how each works. You may use the reset button to remove any current payloads.
# iFrames
**Tip:** Many modern web applications utilize cross-domain IFrames to handle user input, so that even if the web form is vulnerable to XSS, it would not be a vulnerability on the main web application. This is why we are showing the value of `window.origin` in the alert box, instead of a static value like `1`. In this case, the alert box would reveal the URL it is being executed on, and will confirm which form is the vulnerable one, in case an IFrame was being used.
